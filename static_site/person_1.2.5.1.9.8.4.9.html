            <div class="person-text">(1.2.5.1.9.8.4.9) LOUIS IRWIN YOUMANS born December 25, 1868 and died January
1943 – wrote a biography of his father – Historical and Genealogical Notes of the
Youmans and Underhill Families and Connected Family Lines, 1936; an excerpt: “In the
early days of his residence in Seneca, he (Charles Youmans) was associated with D.C. Underhill, a Quaker and a well
known, early settler of the region. Quaker David, as he was generally called, was before the Civil War, a zealous
abolitionist, and participant in the operation of the famed &quot;Underground Railway&quot;, by means of which many slaves escaped
from southern slavery to liberty. A story little known and jealously kept secret for many years was that of the escape of a
slave &quot;Nigger Jim&quot;, whose case was a celebrated one in Illinois history. A runaway from the south he found refuge for a time
in Illinois, but was apprehended, and brought into court to be sent back south, under the fugitive slave law. But while the
proceedings were going on in court, a disturbance arose, developing into a near riot. The slave was grasped by friendly
hands, and which his enemies were so jostled about, apparently by accident as to prevent them from interfering, was
ushered from the court room, and when the confusion was over, and quiet was restored, he had vanished and was never
again apprehended. That is the history of the case so far as was generally known. But long after the death of my father, I
learned from my mother and elder brother, Wm. A. Youmans, that one night two young men traveling up the valley, who
had for traveling companion, a colored man, the &quot;Nigger Jim&quot; of the escape. The two young men of Seneca, guided the
fugitive thru the miles of swamp and forest (for they durst not follow the roads lest they be seen and betrayed) to the old
homestead of David C. Underhill &quot; Quaker David&quot; which still stands along the road at the foot of the north bluff of the
Illinois valley about one and one half miles west of Seneca. On another night, the same two young men, conducted the
fugitive slave on his way to the north and Canada, until they delivered him in safety to other agents of the Underground
Railway, with whom he journeyed on toward liberty. The two young men of Seneca, as I learned, were David L. Carpenter
and Charles E. Youmans, my father. As their action in assisting a runaway slave, would have subjected them to severe
penalty, had it become known at the time, their connection with the affair was kept secret. After the Civil War, of course
there was no necessity for further concealment, but by that time the affair was far in the background of time and importance
that it is not surprising that I, a youth at the time of my father&#x27;s death thirty years later, had no inkling of the story until long
after his death. Nigger Jim escaped to Canada and did not return till the Civil War freed him. I have no information as to his
subsequent history. “ He married February 5, 1902 Alma Wilmarth</div>
