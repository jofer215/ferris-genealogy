            <div class="person-text">(2.1.4.1.3.3) SYLVANUS FERRIS (Sylvinis - is the spelling that has been handled down from
generation to generation) born May 19, 1813 Luzerne Co PA and died February 11, 1877 Kewanee IL;
married 1st 1842 Francis Norton (Fanny) [dau of John &amp; Sarah (Noble)] born 1823 Brawby, England,
arriving in the US 1840 and died February 1853; and 2d 1855 Ruth Holbrook born August 8, 1824 VT
and died 1865. Sylvanus moved 1838 to Wethersfield, Henry, IL. Obituary, The
Kewanee Independent, February 21, 1877: “Died at the residence of Mr. L. Sheldon, in Kewanee on
Sunday, the 11th, Mr. Sylvanus Ferris, age 63 years. Mr. Ferris born in Luzerene County PA, May 19th,
1813 where he resided until the spring of 1838, when he came to Illinois, and settled in Wethersfield. In
1842 he was married to Fanny Norton, with whom he lived about eleven years until she died in
February, 1853. About two years subsequently he was married to Mrs. Ruth Holbroook, with whom he
lived until her death, which occurred in 1865, since which time he has remained, unmarried. He was an
amiable, kindhearted man, a good citizen and highly esteemed by his neighbors. In business he
displayed a large amount of energy and perseverance, was public spirited and was largely interested in
the business enterprises of the early settlement of Wethersfield. He rented the old Wethersfield Colony
Steam Flour and Saw Mill, which he managed for a number of years, and to him belongs the credit of
opening the first ‘coal bank’ in that part of the state. He will long be remembered by all the early settles
of this vicinity as one of the most valued and use members of this society - to whom appeals for
assistance were never made in vain.” [note - death date in obit is wrong.]Born to Sylvanus and Francis
