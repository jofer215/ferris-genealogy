            <div class="person-text">(1.1.3.1.4.9) EMILY FERRIS BLAKENEY &quot;Emma&quot; born November 1, 1842 Peekskillon-the-Hudson NY and died after 1908; married 1st January 22, 1862 in NY, Milo
Newton Wells [son of Thomas Stratton &amp; Susan F. (Heath) Wells], of Chicago, born
October 16, 1837 Waterbury VT and died January 10, 1876 at St. Louis MO, as a result
of a severe cold; buried Bellefontaine Cemetery. Emily married 2d July 12, 1888 at the
Trinity Church, New York City, Joseph Burr Bennett, M.D., who died July 23, 1904;
buried in Cypress Hills. Emily, Milo, and his parents all moved to St. Louis to become
the Western branch of the Gold Pen Manufacturing business. After Milo’s death, Emily
returned to New York with the children. She wrote the portion of the Blakeney-Sabin
Genealogy book that was about her mother, father, and siblings; she wrote it after 1908,
when she was 66 years of age. Much of this info is from her work, so we have much
to thank her for! Some of her comments: &quot;In looking backward, I cannot forget to
mention the pleasant week’s visit with my husband at my Uncle Charles Ferris’ home in
Meadville PA – the wedding speech of congratulation at the hotel, with the big sleigh
outside awaiting us, then the aunt, the different cousins at Meadville, the hospitable
entertainment, the good old stories galore, until the clock would strike twelve, with the
announcement to retire&quot;. &quot;In past years my best-directed energies outside of my family
have been in developing the faculties of children, in the infant department of Sunday
Schools and Kindergartens. I received a course of kindergarten instruction in St. Louis in
1876&quot;. &quot;I always thought, until late years, that my mother Lydia A. Ferris, born in the
old homestead at Peekskill-on-Hudson. My maternal grandfather, Joseph Ferris married
Lydia Seymour, of Norwalk CT, December 25, 1788, when 21 years of age, and with his
father’s approval commenced life at St. John’s, New Brunswick, Canada. My mother
was the eldest of seven children born there. When war was declared between France and

England and Napoleon was fitting out a fleet to attack the Provinces, my grandfather had
large and lucrative possessions there on the waterfront, and being a U.S. subject could
claim no indemnity in case of destruction. He therefore sold his possessions at a great
sacrifice and returned, with his seven children, to the old homestead at Peekskill-onHudson, where he born. After his return three more children were added to the seven&quot;.
