owning free house, residing Cold Spring Village Rock Street. From the Centennial 1870-1970 of the
United Methodist Church, Cold Spring NY: ‘A river tragedy occurred on Monday morning, March 9,
1925. Shortly after 6 o&#x27;clock Sylvanus Ferris and Row Merante started to row across the Hudson to
their carpentry jobs at West Point. The river was practically free of ice when they started from this
side. Nearing Constitution Island, according to reports, they probably realized that an approaching floe
of ice would overtake them, so they head for the island. Believing that they had reached their
destination in time, observers paid no further heed. Some minutes later the boat was seen floating
alone with the ice but with no occupants. A general alarm was then sent out, and the enlisted men
assembled on the shore of West Point noticed that one man was clinging to the boat. After nearly three
hours of careful paddling through the floating ice, four enlisted men in two canoes found Mr. Ferris tied
to the boat. The unconscious Mr. Ferris was rushed to Engineer&#x27;s Hospital but he died at 10:45. There
was no trace of Mr. Merante. He had lived on Garden Street and was survived by a widow and three
small children. Mr. Ferris, living in what had once been the Rock Street School, was survived by his
widow, his son Warren, his daughter Mrs. Roger Free (Thompson), and a brother James F. Ferris.
Though not given to much talking, Sylvanus was always ready to discuss local history. He was a
member of the Putnam County Historical Society and of Martelaer&#x27;s Rock Association (reorganized as
