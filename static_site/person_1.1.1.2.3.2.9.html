William T. Wright
Descended from the old Puritan stock, his ancestors coming to this country in the Mayflower or soon after, the subject of
this sketch has inherited the same stanch characteristics that wrought so nobly in opening up this continent. He has ever
been a pioneer, not only in leading the way
into new lands but also in fostering industries and in aiding his fellows to launch out in the fields of enterprise.
He was born in Massachusetts on January 7, 1830, to Z. W. and Mariah (Faunce) Wright, who came to Ohio ten years
later. His father had moulded bullets for use in the war of 1812, early showing the real spirit of patriotism that gave this
country its independence. When our subject was sixteen years of age his father died, leaving much of the responsibility of
the family upon his shoulders. In 1853 he turned toward the Golden state, going thither by way of the isthmus and
remaining there for six years. In 1859 he returned to Ohio and entered business in the oil fields, selling steam engines and
machinery. Succeeding this he went to Jasper county, Missouri, and engaged in flour milling business, together with
farming. Here he remained until 1879, when he crossed the plains with mule teams and settled in this county, taking a preemption near where Milton now stands. Later he bought property in the town and platted it, giving it the name of North
Milton. He was one of the first men to demonstrate that the gravel around Milton would produce fruit, and with keen
foresight for the welfare of the settlers and the advancement of the interests of this county he induced others to try and raise
for themselves. His experiments in handling the various kinds and in various ways have been of untold value to the
orchardists of this section, demonstrating what varieties to raise and what methods to be pursued in their culture. One year
he raised three thousand pounds of strawberries on one acre and eight thousand pounds of grapes on one acre. In addition to
this arduous labor of fruit culture he operated a lumber yard in Milton for nine years. He now owns about sixty lots in
Milton beside his land adjoining the town, and also one of the finest brick blocks in the city, being also a stockholder in the
Bank of Milton, of which institution he is a trustee. The bank is in a most prosperous condition, its deposits now being
nearly one hundred thousand dollars annually. He has acted as councilman for several terms, ever manifesting that public
spirit and breadth of mind so praiseworthy and pleasant.
The marriage of Mr. Wright and Miss Laura, daughter of Nathaniel and Laura Lattin, occurred in Ohio on January 6,
1861. To them have been born the following children: Helen M., widow of A. J. Russel; C. A., in Louisiana operating a
schooner on the gulf; Jennie L., wife of Ira W. Berry, living near; and one dying in infancy while they lived in Missouri. Mr.
Wright and wife are members of the Christian church, he assisting to organize it and acting as one of its officers for some
time. He is a man of ability and has been a factor in the development of this county, while he has ever so demeaned himself
that the confidence and respect of the people are freely given
to him.
