            <div class="person-text">(3.10.1.2.1.9.4.5.1.2) LILLITH MARY DARBY born June 7, 1892 Clarksville, Iowa and died there
August 1987. “Lillith was an outstanding teacher in the Clarksville area for many years. She was
honored with many outstanding educator awards &amp; memorials from her students. She loved teaching,
and continued to be active in the lives of her students until she was past 90 years of age. Everyone who
knew her knew what a wonderful teacher she was &amp; felt privileged to have had their family be a part of
her teaching career. Grandpa Clarence Darby told me that when she was a young woman she was very
pretty, &amp; was sought after by many of the young men in the county, but Lillith always preferred to
teach rather than to marry &amp; have her own children. He said she had many chances to marry, but chose
to remain single.”</div>
