            <div class="person-text">(1.6) JOHN FERRIS JR. (probably first born of John) born c1661 (birth dates conflict
considering the purported birth date of his mother) Westchester NY and died there
November 1729. This John was referred to as John Jr. in the 1682 record. John Jr. took
the oath of allegiance to the King of England in 1698. John married, c1714, rather late in
life, Elizabeth Clarke born circa 1700 (based on these dates, Elizabeth would have been
14) and died before 1742 [dau of Daniel and his second wife Hannah (Underhill)
Barnes]. Will: In the name of God, Amen. October 19, 1729. I, JOHN FERRIS, of the
Borough Town of Westcheter, Esq., being sick. My executors are to sell all my estate

all the rest to my son, John, and my executors are to pay for his bringing up and

executors. Witnesses, William Forster, Henry Gillam, John Smith, Proved, November
15, 1729. After John’s death Elizabeth remarried, 1736, John Griffin. (Jim – in previous
editions, I listed the wrong John as 1.6.1 – Chaplain Ferris’ Volume 1 was dated in 1980

and in 1984, based on his and Gail Moore’s research, it was determined that the John
Ferris who was formerly known as the “Griffin Fragment” was the son of John and
Elizabeth (Clarke) Ferris and was the correct (1.6.1), so that correction has been made.
Gail called my attention to this error and provided the documentation – thanks Gail!)
(For informational purposes, I have included the “other” John twig at the end of this
chapter.) Born to John and Elizabeth were:</div>
