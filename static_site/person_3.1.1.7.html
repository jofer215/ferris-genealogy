            <div class="person-text">(3.1.1.7) EBENEZER FERRIS (8RLL-TH) (Rev.) born c1735 and died January 9, 1824 age 88;
buried North Street Cemetery (Northfield), Stamford CT beside his wife. Ebenezer withdrew from
membership in the First Congregational Church in Stamford about 1769 to join the Baptists, becoming
very active as an elder of that church and in founding other churches of that denomination. He had no
children of his own. He married Abigail Weed [dau of Captain Ebenezer and Mary (Bell) Weed]
[whose mother married Josiah Ferris (3.1.1.2)??] born November 5, 1728 Stamford and died there
October 19, 1818. The church records and the tombstone give conflicting information: the church
records have Ebenezer dying in 1824 at age 99 and Abigail in 1818 at age 89. This union had no
offspring, but Ebenezer was guardian for others; the 1790 census shows his household has having two
males under 16, three females and one other free person. He left the majority of his estate to the
children he raised.</div>
