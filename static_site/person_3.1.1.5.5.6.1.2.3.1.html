&quot;Harlington Wood, Jr., 73, is a 1948 graduate of the University of Illinois Law School. From
1948 to 1969, Judge Wood practiced law in Springfield. He was U.S. Attorney for the Southern District
of Illinois from 1958 to 1961. From 1969 to 1973, he held high-level positions at the Justice
Department, including Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division. Judge Wood was appointed by
President Nixon to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois in 1973. President Ford
appointed Judge Wood to the Seventh Circuit in 1976. Judge Wood took senior status in 1992.
Overall reports suggest that Judge Wood is a good judge and a solid performer on the Seventh
Circuit. He is considered to be thoughtful, careful, experienced, and fair.&quot;
&quot;Capt. Harlington J. Wood, Jr., son of Judge and Mrs. Harlington Wood, was among witnesses who
attended the signing of surrender documents by Gen. Tomoyuki Yamashita, commander of all Japanese
forces. Capt. Wood, who serves as aide to Maj. Gen. Leavy, is watching the officer affixing the seal.
Lt. Gen. Jonathan Wainwright is seated second from the left. The historic scene occurred in Baguio,
northern Luzon (Philippines).&quot; &quot;Was honored by several presidential appointments: (1) United States
attorney, Southern District of Illinois (by President Eisenhower in 1958); (2) United States District
Judge in the Southern District of Illinois (by President Nixon in 1973); (3) Assistant Attorney General
in charge of the Civil Division at the Department of Justice (by President Nixon in 1972); (4) Judge of
the 7th District United States Court of Appeals (by President Ford in 1976).&quot; &quot;Served the U.S.
government as a negotiator and mediator in the peace demonstrations in Washington in 1971. He
further distinguished himself as chief negotiator for the U.S. government at Wounded Knee, South
Dakota, in 1973.&quot;
&quot;Judge Harlington Wood, Jr. of Petersburg, Senior Circuit Judge of the United States Court of
Appeals, will leave Friday for several weeks in Moscow where he will work with Russian judges. He
is one of five federal judges from around the country selected by the State Department from over 200
volunteers to make the trip.
The group will learn about the Russian judicial situation as they try to adapt their legal structure
to keep up with the other changes in that country. They may assist in drafting a new statute, give
lectures on their judicial administration, and participate in seminars on issues of law and the role of the
judiciary.
This will be Judge Wood&#x27;s sixth trip to Russia, where he has visited all areas of the country.
When he was there before it was the Soviet Union. On one trip to Moscow he went into the Tomb in
Red Square to take a look at Stalin and Lenin. As he was leaving the Tomb he saw the police moving
into Red Square and dispersing the crowd. The tomb was closed that night, and Stalin was taken out
and buried away from public view just outside the Kremlin wall. By chance, Judge Wood was one of
the last people to see Stalin, and he reports that it looks like Lenin&#x27;s days on display are also
numbered.&quot;</div>
