            <div class="person-text">(2.1.4.1.1.8.10) ARTEMUS C. FERRIS (1847-) – Medina Dailey Journal, November 14, 1929 – Mrs
Electa Ferris who has made her home with Mrs Alice Smith of Knowlesville for the past two years
passed away this morning at the Albion Memorial Hospital where she was taken Wednesday afternoon
for treatment. Mrs Ferris has been poorly for several weeks but no alarm was felt for her until recently,
and her sudden going will come as a shock to her many friends. She was a member of the Knowlesville
W.C.T.U., and the Grange, and took a part in all affairs of the Presbyterian Church. She was the widow
of the late A. (Artemus) C. Ferris of West Albion and had always resided in that vicinity. Electa Porter
Ferris (1865-1929); buried Union Cemetery, Orleans Co NY – not sure this is the correct placement –
she would have been almost 20y young than A.C.</div>
