            <div class="person-text">(2.6.3.3.6.7) EDWARD LEBARON KETCHUM

(2.6.3.3.7) JAMES KETCHEM settled at Kingston in 1783, a native of Stamford CT here he had some
property. He was a pilot of a vessel and went to sea on it part of the time. Before the Revolution began
he was known to be afavorable to the British and in consequence was visited by a number of armed
men representing the revolutionary party and was by them forced to sign a paper agreeing to support
their side. For a time he was left unmolested, but at the beginning of 1787 he was notified that he must
take active service for the revolutionary cause. He preferred to remain British and made his escape to
the British lines in January 1777. In making his escape across Long Island Sound his vessel was sunk.
He joined a colony of refugees at Lloyd’s Neck and engaged in the wood trade with New York. He left
New York with the first fleet of Loylists of 1783. His property was confiscated by the revolution
committee. It consisted of 1 ˝ acres in Norwalk purchased for Ł25, New York currency, a valuable
building site, 3 ˝ acres pasture and meadow in Fairfield purchased in 1772 for Ł21 currency, a house
and lot in Fairfield, lot costing Ł3, 13s, 4p, currency in 1771, house which cost at least Ł100 to build,
seven acres ploughed and pasture lands in Norwalk valued at Ł10, personal property one cow, one
horse and colt, Ł4 in currency, one iron cow, one scythe, one cradle, one shovel, spade and hoe, wheels,
reels, etc. He stated debts due to him amounted to Ł130 lawful, paid into the treasury. He owed about
