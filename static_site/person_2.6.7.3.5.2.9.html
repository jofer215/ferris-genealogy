Levi Knapp Allen, ninth child, sixth son of Andrew Lee and Clarinda Knapp Allen was born 1 Apr 1842. The family joined
the Mormon Church and moved west with the Saints. They spent the winter in a small log house in Missouri. His father and
older brothers worked at harvesting corn and splitting rails. The story Susan loved to tell on Levi must have happened here.
He was about four years old and his Father was bringing in a log to put on the fire in the fireplace. Levi, seeing the logs, and
his father trying to get it on the fire, was dancing around clapping his hands and spatting his knees. He said, “That&#x27;s a man!
That&#x27;s a man, Father Put it on”. It shows Levi&#x27;s character, always loyal and encouraging. After crossing the plains with his
family, living for a time in Provo, he went with his brothers to San Bernardino, California. He stayed there until his mother
desired to return to see her other children in Cache Valley. After the death of his mother, he and Lydia continued to make a
home in Richmond. Levi filed on 16o acres where he worked until Lydia died 15 Oct 1870. He relinquished this land and
moved out to Cove and took up a homestead of 16o acres near his b r o the r s, Charles and Andrew. In 1871 he built a log
house which he called his home for 11 years. During this time he had his meals with his brother Andrew&#x27;s family and
Minerva, Andrew&#x27;s wife, helped care for such needs as laundry, etc. As time went on he bought more land and went into
partnership with Andrew. In 1882 they bought the homestead of Charles who was going to Arizona. Together they owned
more than 1500 acres of land from the Idaho line south to the Lewiston Sugar Factory. They raised hay and wheat, and fed
many cattle. Before he married he was a great help financially to his nephews and nieces. He supplied money for missions,
education, and provided help for many to buy farmland on time payments. He never drew a note of any kind for these things
as he believed in encouraging them to build homes and establish themselves He loved his relatives and helped provide the
necessities of life for his widowed sisters and sisters—in—law. He encouraged his nieces and nephews to get good
educations. He had never had a chance to go to school until they came to Richmond where he attended school for about
three months. His mother had always been the teacher for the family and the reader, speller and arithmetic books had been
the boys&#x27; constant companions when they h e r d e d cows in Provo. When the Richmond teacher asked him what grade he
was in, he told her what little schooling he had had. J. W. (Sol) Hendricks, a boy at school, later said, “We laughed at him
for coming to school, yet when called to spell he could down the whole school and in reading and arithmetic w a s f a r
ahead of us who had attended school. I a1w a y s had a great deal of respect for him, his steadfastness and modesty.”
Levi had typhoid fever when he was 25 years old, which made him partially deaf in the left ear. It made him self-conscious
about holding public positions but he was always glad to help with the Lord&#x27;s work with manual labor or money. He was
outstanding in his efforts in the collection of the Allen record, temple work, and the building of the first church and
schoolhouses in Cove. In 1874-5 Levi was called to go to St. George to work on the temple for six months. He left in the
fall and came back in the spring. The roads were almost impassable with mud and water. He arrived home too late for the
welcome home party given for the men who worked on the temple. He also helped build the Logan and Salt Lake Temples.
He drove the 100 miles to Salt Lake City many times in a light-weight wagon to attend the temple dedication and general
conferences. Besides other duties, he was in the Sunday School Superintendency for several years. Levi drove a freight line
from Corinne, Utah to Blackfoot, Idaho.
