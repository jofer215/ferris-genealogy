            <div class="person-text">(5.1.1.5) SYLVANUS FERRIS (AFN: 8RK9-PG) (stone has Sylvenus) a Revolutionary worthy, born
August 10, 1737 Greenwich CT and died January 12, 1824 Salem (Lewisboro), Westchester, NY;
headstone says he died January 12, 1821 age 86y 5m 2d – 1821 does not track with 86y so think the
1821 on the stone’s photo is 1824; he was about two years old when his father died and his mother was
appointed guardian of the children. The mother died 1744 and Silvanus&#x27;s Uncle Samuel (5.1.3), was
appointed guardian of the children and executor of the estate of James (5.1.1). Silvanus served as a
Private in Captain Stephen White’s Company of Stanwich, 9th Regiment during the French and Indian
War and was called to service during the month of August 1757, when the company marched to the
relief of Fort William Henry. Silvanus married September 10, 1761 at Greenwich, Mary Mead (3.5.5.8).
Silvanus and Mary lived in their native town prosperous and happy until the outbreak of the
Revolutionary War (1775-1783) when Mr. Ferris espousing the cause of the patriots, became so
persecuted by the Tory contingent in and about Greenwich that he decided to move with his family
across the state line into Westchester Co NY; he purchased May 28, 1782 of Eli Rundle (Randall?) a
farm property on each side of the road leading from Canaan Parish to Ridgefield, located about four
miles south of South Salem; moved his family there immediately. The homestead stood nearly opposite
a country store and post office which was operated by Silvanus, who made a business of farming, store
keeping and entertaining travelers with the homestead being maintained as an Inn until about 1815. It
became known as the Silvanus Ferris Homestead and was still standing in 1934 and was beautifully
maintained by the owner. The store and post office remained until 1905 when destroyed by fire. Mrs.
Ferris, with saddlebags filled with stockings of her own and neighbors&#x27; knitting, made annual visits to
the city of New York on horseback, disposed of the goods, purchased such articles as herself and
neighbors needed, and brought what she could home with her. On one of these visits, Mrs. Ferris pulled
a sprout from one of the large black walnut trees north of Harlem Bridge for a whip. When she reached
her home she planted it, and an immense tree grew on the old homestead. Mr. and Mrs. Ferris&#x27; family
consisted of four sons and five daughters. Seven of them were born in Greenwich and two in Salem.
Silvanus was frequently elected to public office and in 1783, one year after moving to Lewisboro, was
chosen Highway Commissioner. Whether inadvertently or not, Silvanus set fire to a tract of woodland
belonging to Thacher Hayes, but at the town meeting in 1811, it was voted that the fine, which had
been imposed upon him on that occasion &quot;be given off&quot;. Silvanus was a Presbyterian and always
faithful to family prayers at night and morning, always standing when he prayed or asked blessing at
the table, his family and guests also standing. Silvanus and Mary are buried in the old Presbyterian
Churchyard at South Salem NY (Photos).
Silvanus’ Will:
The will of Sylvanus left to his four daughters the sum of $40.00 each and &quot;the whole of my
beds and beding and clothing except what is before reserved for my wife during her natural life, then to
be equally divided between them.&quot; The will was made in 1819, but Sylvanus outlived his wife by
about 18 months. His son, Gideon was Executor and his daughter Molly, wife of Henry Hayes,
designated her brother Sylvanus of Herkimer Co, as her attorney to collect:

Know all men by these presents, that Whereas Sylvanus Ferris, late of the town of South Salem,
County of Westchester &amp; State of New York, by his last will and testament in writing did give &amp;

Molly Hayes and of the said will made &amp; constituted his son, Gideon Ferris of the said town of Salem

Personal traits of Silvanus Ferris as stated in letter written by Cyrus Mead Ferris on June 28, 1889 to
Charles Ferris Gettemy: &quot;It may be interesting to know something of the general traits and character of
our grandfather, Silvanus Ferris the gist from my own observation and recollection although I was but a
boy. I thought a great deal of him for I never remember of his giving me an unpleasant word, although
I lived in the same house until his death over 12 years. Much of my leisure time was spent with him in
his room, or in his out of door walks attending to business, etc. I remember how well he looked. He
was a tall, straight man with a full head of long white hair, always wearing a smooth shaven face, and

dark eyes, weighing, I should think, 200 or more, spry and active until a few days before his death, and
was always much respected by his neighbors and friends, dignified in appearance, though social and
friendly with all. By profession he was a Presbyterian, a Christian man, most always attending church
though four miles away, faithful to his prayers morning and night under all circumstances, always
standing up when he prayed or when asking a blessing at the table and his family and guest at the same
time standing likewise. He was a man of even disposition never petulant and uneasy, but happy and
liked to see others so, never using a word of bad or profane language and for those excellent traits of
character I have heard his neighbors say he was Reverenced and respected.
I have been told he never did much hard work after his boys were large enough to do it. My
father used to tell a story about his hoeing corn. He usually sent his boys out to work first, he followed
later. When the horn blew for dinner, he would set up his hoe in the row at the place where he
stopped. One day, while he was taking a nap after dinner the boys played until near time to come out;
then, to make him think they had worked, they sat his hoe back a few rows. He came, took his hoe and
hoed the same rows over again to the great amusement of the boys, as they used to tell him of it in later
years.
To show how easy he took things, he had a tenement house about 1/2 mile from his home. One
day it caught fire and when word came to him he arose from his chair and reaching for his pipe began
to fill it. His wife urged him to hurry, to which he replied, he should light up his pipe before he went.
I speak of this to show his disposition, while grandmother was quite the opposite and called a
good thorough businesswoman.
I well remember what pleased him much and he liked to tell of it. In the time of the
Revolutionary War before he left Greenwich CT, the Torries (or cowboys, so called) stole everything
they could that was useful, his crops, his horse and a pair of oxen. The oxen were stolen by a neighbor
named Bishop living in Darien, the next town, who years later after became a Quaker quite wealthy and
respected, but it so troubled him that when he made his will he made provision that Silvanus Ferris
should be paid for one ox of the oxen with interest which he received. It pleased him to think that the
old Quaker dare not die without paying for the ox he had and exposing himself after he was dead.&quot;
(Jim - there is conflicting info on how many children they had.)
The personal records of his life are meager and not illuminative. Certain it is that he born
neither to poverty nor wealth, and it may be that his finest inheritance was a body and disposition that
enabled him to achieve an exceptionally long life in a day when this was not easy to attain, and that he
was a father of a numerous progeny. Longevity and large families were characteristics of many of his
descendants. In the evening of his life he was described by a contemporary as a “tall and straight man
with a full head of long white hair, always wearing a smooth shaven face, dark eyes and weighing
about two hundred pounds, or more, spry and active until a few years prior to his death, and was always
much respected by his neighbors and friends, dignified in appearance though social and friendly with
all. By profession he was a Presbyterian, a Christian gentleman… for these excellent traits of character
I have heard his neighbors say he was Reverenced and respected.” This contemporary also pointed out
that, “I have been told that he never did much work after his boys were large enough to do it.” Born to
Silvanus and Mary were:</div>
