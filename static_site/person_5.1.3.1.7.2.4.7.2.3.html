            <div class="person-text">(5.1.3.1.7.2.4.7.2.3) BYRON HUBERT HICKS born November 9, 1911 Alma MI; married, May 3,
1934 in Mt. Pleasant MI, Alita Mae Braman [dau of Arthur Clyde &amp; Alta Maude (Lloyd) Braman] born
August 18, 1910 Reece MI and died December 18, 1998 St. Louis MI. Byron farmed, raised and
milked dairy cattle until 1963; he worked at Crippens until he retired. He purchased a 1938 Model B
John Deere soon after he was married; it was rebuilt and repainted in the 1980s, and still runs today.
He also has a 1952 Model B John Deere that is still in good condition. Alita&#x27;s father was an army band
musician in the Spanish-American War, who served in Cuba and the Philippines. Later in civilian life
he organized and toured with his group, The Braman Band. They won a state band championship in
1915; it was with this band that Alita first performed on the piano at age 4, a natural musician from the
beginning. In 1921-22, Alita, the oldest of four orphaned brothers and sisters, went to live with Frank
and Nellie Collin and their children, resides of Mt. Pleasant. During the summer of 1921, Alita first met
10-year-old Hubert Hicks at a church camp meeting in Cedar Lake MI. Off and on they saw each other
over the years. She graduated from Mt. Pleasant High School. In 1928, she was a student at Emmanuel
Missionary College, Berrian Springs MI and amazingly, Hubert, a new graduate of Alma High School,
was also a 1928 student at Emmanuel. They both came back to their home after leaving school that
year. Hubert joined his father in farming and Alita went to work for Bill and Agness Moody at the
Moody Funeral Home in Alma, as housekeeper and to help with their children. She and Hubert became
better friends and got married. Unlike most newlyweds in those days, they missed getting &quot;belled&quot; at
the farm house because people thought Alita was working, taking care of the Moody kids at night while
Hubert was at the farm. Little did they know that Alita was there every night. Alita&#x27;s love for music
continued. She, Hubert, and Little Ardis were involved in music at many churches in Central Michigan.
As the children came along, they all became involved in music, in schools, churches, and the Michigan
Masonic Home. The rural school music program also grew. Alita taught music in schools at over
Gratiot County, plus piano to many private students. At one time over 50 students called her their piano
teacher. In the early years, she taught most of her private students in their own homes on their own
piano. At the same time she was involved in church music, serving the Alma/Twin Cities Seventh Day
Adventist Church as pianist and organist for over 64 years. She also served the East Superior Christian
Church, Alma, for 36 years. The relationship with the Moody Funeral Home continued with her
becoming their organist for funerals, working for the Moodys, Wolfels and Luxes for almost 50 years.
Her tent home at the Michigan SDA Camp meeting, Grand Ledge MI was amazing, her kids in tow. For
37 years of camp meetings she served the kids on the piano. On June 27, 1998, she played the piano for
the primary age children at the Michigan SDA camp meeting, Cedar Lake MI; then she and Hubert
went on to Owosso and she played the organ for her son Harold&#x27;s wedding that evening; next morning
she was at the East Superior Christian Church; that evening she fell and broke her hip. They raised

three foster children: Harold Henry Braman; Walter Alan Braman; and Terrance Lee Braman. Born to
them were:</div>
