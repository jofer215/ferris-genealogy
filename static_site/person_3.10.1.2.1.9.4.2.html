            <div class="person-text">(3.10.1.2.1.9.4.2) URANA A. DARBY (twin) born July 10, 1834 Cortland Co NY and died there
February 12, 1839; gravestone inscription on Urana A. Darby&#x27;s grave is very hard to read. It reads she
&quot;died (2) 4 yrs 6 months, 28 days.&quot; The date of death appears to be 2/12/1839. It could say she died at 4
years, 6 months, 28 days, or it could say she died at 2 yrs. 6 months 28 days. It is impossible to tell
whether or not she was 2 1/2 yrs. old or 4 1/2 yrs old at death in 1839 from the cemetery inscription.
The cemetery list from Cortland Co says she died 2/12/1838, however, if she was 4 yrs 6 mo., 28 days
old at this time, her birth date would be only 1 month after Thomas &amp; Urana&#x27;s wedding, which would
be very doubtful, since her father, a minister married them in a public ceremony announced in the
newspaper. So it appears the date of death must be 2/12/1839 as it appears on the stone. If she was 4
yrs, 6 months, or 8 months, she is a twin with sister Cordelia. That may be why there appears to be a
(2) inserted before her age of 4 yrs, 8 months, 28 days. It may have been to signify that she was part of
(2) or a twin. Cordelia &amp; Urana are both names from a Shakespearian play, and they are dependent on
each other in the play. However, that is speculation. We are going to list them that way though as the
only birth information we have for Cordelia appears to be early 1834 from the census information. The
best interpretation upon observation of the gravestone is that Urana A. Darby was 4 yrs, 6 months, 28

days, she is a twin to Cordelia. Urana may have been born July 1836 instead of July 1834 though, per
the difficulty in reading the stone, which has been etched heavily by acid rain.
3.10.1.2.1.9.4.3) WAYLAND D. DARBY born May 03, 1835 Homer, Cortland, NY and died January
21, 1874 Clarksville, Butler, Iowa.
Clarksville Star, Jan 21, 1874, Clarksville, Iowa:
&quot;Died Jan 21, 1847 at 10 o&#x27;clock A.M. at the home of his brother, Thomas, after severe sickness of
eight weeks, Wayland D. Darby aged 39 years. It is with saddest of feelings we chronicle the death of
our fellow citizen. Mr. Darby was born in Homer NY and remained in that State until about 15 years
ago, when he started out into the world on his search for a home and a fortune. He traveled for about 15
years, visiting every State in the Union, finally settling in this county about four years ago, with his
brother Thomas, and at once actively engaged in agriculture and stock. As a friend, Mr. Darby was true
and faithful; as a citizen he was esteemed and respected by all who knew him, as a businessman, he
was active, energetic and determined. For the past two years he has taken an active part in the Order of
Patrons of Husbandry and had, by his energy and good judgment, made his influence felt. Mr. Darby
was a man of good ability and good judgment, his extensive travels and knowledge of the world giving
him the advantage of much experience for a young man. In his death we have lost a good friend, the
community at large a good citizen, and society one of its ornaments. Wayland was a single man. He
was in great suffering during his sickness, but bore it with the greatest courage and did not yield to the
grim destroyer until he could not longer hold out. The remains, upon the urgent request of his father,
were conveyed to New York for internment (at the Cortland Rural Cemetery) accompanied by his
brother Thomas Darby.&quot;</div>
