REV. WALTER L. FERRIS, the present pastor of the Congregational Church of Cherokee, Iowa, born at Oneida, Knox
County, Illinois, July 31, 1852, and is a son of Lyman B. and Harriet A. (Newcomb) Ferris, who were among the early
settlers of that county. He was reared to farm life, and till the age of twenty-one years he worked for the neighboring
farmers by the day and month, attending the Oneida public schools in the winter. It was not until he had attained his
majority that he entered Wheaton College; there he found himself all but penniless, but he was filled with an intense desire
to do something in the world, and he set to work with a fixed determination to go through at all hazards. His hardy farm life
here came in play; he plowed and husked corn, trimmed hedges, sawed wood, did anything to earn the fifteen cents an hour
paid the students for their labor. In June 1879 he graduated in the regular classical course of this institution. The following
eight months he supplied the pulpit of the Congregational Church of Wataga, Illinois, teaching at the same time a district
school near by called the &quot;Hard Scrabble School,&quot; and justly reputed one of the most difficult to control. In September 1880,
Mr. Ferris began a course of theological studies at Union Park Theological Seminary, Chicago. The first years of his
seminary course he filled the pulpit of the Congregational Church at Prospect Park, Illinois. Then for a year and a half he
was pastor of the Northwest Branch of the First Congregational Church of Chicago. All the while he was learning the
practical with the theological. At the close of his three years&#x27; seminary course he was called to the pastorate of the
Congregational Church of Dundee, Illinois. This he considered his first permanent work. Though his labors had been
blessed for nearly four years he could now feel that at last the time had come when he could devote all his time to his

chosen calling. He spent over six years at Dundee, and the church was blessed with several revivals; during this pastorate
130 united with the church, many of them being heads of families. In May of 1889 Mr. Ferris received a call from the
church in Cherokee, and began work here the first Sabbath in July 1889. He has ever been a radical temperance worker;
while at Dundee he was repeatedly called to speak to the various Prohibition clubs, and other temperance organizations in
the towns about him. He is a man of deepest sincerity and exceeding earnestness of purpose and begins the work in his
present field with very encouraging prospects. The congregations are large, the membership united; the Sabbath-school is
prosperous; the outlook seems propitious. Mr. Ferris was untied in marriage August 9, 1882, to Miss Harriet McEwen,
daughter of Ezra and Mary McEwen. Two children were born of this union, Millie and Hattie. Mrs. Ferris was called from
this earth September 26, 1887.
