            <div class="person-text">(1.1.4.4.1.3.6.3.3) JOYCE MCGRATH born October 6, 1923 Barron, Barron, WI;

Torrence CA; cremains were interred at the National Cemetery, Riverside CA. After
living his younger years in South Caroline, James joined the Army Air Corps in 1942;
became an Army Supply Officer in WWII, and returned to civilian life in Seattle WA,
after the War. During the Korean War he was recalled to active duty, stayed and became
a career Air Force office, retiring as a Colonel in about 1972. He and his family served
two tours in Germany and at least that many at the Pentagon. They then moved to
Torrence CA, where he worked for Northrup Aviation, in the aircraft and B-2
development units, for about 15 years before retiring a second time in 1990. James
enjoyed the arts. As a young man he was active in the theater and enjoyed singing. He
was a member of the First United Methodist Church Cathedral Choir for many years
until work schedules made it frequently impossible to attend rehearsals and worship.
The Brauns have been loyal and gracious supporters of the work of the church for many
years. James supported Joyce in volunteer work for the Meals on Wheels program.
James inspired family and friends with his gentle spirit and legacy of moral values, hard
work, constant spirit of learning. His extensive travels in his work enriched the family’s
life through the artifacts and objects he brought home which he selected with great care
and discrimination. He was generous in sharing resources with others and was a wise
and gentle man. His gentle friendship reached out to many others beyond his family. His
special interests included stamp collecting, flower gardening, woodworking,
photography, the Redskins, and his newest passsion, the Computer. His barbecued
turkey was a savored and favored treat for his family and friends. Born to them were:</div>
