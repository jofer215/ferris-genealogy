            <div class="person-text">(3.1.1.5.2.3.6) JOHN MCDOWELL PELTON (John A. McDowell Pelton) born February 7, 1839
Farmer&#x27;s Valley PA; enlisted in Company H, 58th Regiment of Pennsylvania Volunteers, serving with
honor until the latter part of 1863, when he was mustered out so that he could be mustered in again as
Second Lieutenant of his company. As the company had not enough men to entitle it to two lieutenants,
he was ordered home as a recruiting officer, until the company could be filled up. In 1864, Captain
Cowles having been authorized to raise a company, Mr. Pelton was the first to enlist in it, and on its
organization received a commission as the Second Lieutenant. He served with honor until on the death
of his first lieutenant, he was promoted to the First Lieutenancy, after which he led h is company in all
the in which it was engaged, until in his last battle on the heights of Petersburg VA, April 2, 1865,
where he fell, at about 11 a.m., wounded in the right shoulder by a case-shot; taken that night 30 miles
in an ambulance to the hospital at City Point, he here died April 14, 1865. His body reached home at
Farmer&#x27;s Valley PA, April 23d, and was buried there in Fairmount Cemetery, April 26th, much regretted
by all, a good soldier and a noble man.</div>
