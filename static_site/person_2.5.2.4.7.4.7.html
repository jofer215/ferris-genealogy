(she is listed on the stone in the cemetery). From History of Stamford: Upon the outbreak of the Civil
War, he cheerfully entered the Union service, though at great personal sacrifice. In his first term of
service, 3 months, he won for himself the love and confidence of the entire company. Though not in
command, it is not too much to say that he was the man in the company to whom they had cause to
look for advice and help; and under whom they would gladly trust themselves, if the country should
again call them to the field. Accordingly, after a few weeks of rest from the severe service they had
seen, when the question was raised, who shall take another company of our sons to the field, he seemed
to be the one whom all our people turned. With unaffected modesty he urged his sense of
incompetency. He had received no special military training and he felt no military ambition. He had
already sacrificed much, but with every interest of his country still at stake, he could not long hesitate.
He accepted the command to give himself thenceforth to his county. He was in the 10 th Connecticut, a
regiment destined to win no mean honors for the state, whose name and fame they were proud to bear.
In the famous Burnside expedition into North Carolina, they were not a whit behind the bravest
regiment under their gallant commander, and Captain Hoyt’s company was never wanting where daring
was needed. The zealous patriotism, and the calm and deliberate devotion of their captain were, also,
shared by the men. But he was not long to command his company. The local fever seized upon his
healthy frame and he was forced to yield. Though warned again and again of his danger, he would not
ask for a furlough while his company needed his care. He risked his own life that he might care for
them; and cheerfully paid the price of his whole-souled devotion. His death occurred on board the New
Brunswick, at Newbern NC March 20, 1862. Born to them were:</div>
