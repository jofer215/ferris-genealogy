            <div class="person-text">(2.1.4.1.3.3.4.5.3.2.2) JAMES SCOTT FERRIS (Photo) born March 12, 1954 San Antonia TX;
married March 11, 1985 in San Antonio Linda Sue Johnson [dau of Dean Everret &amp; Mary Ethel
(Cassel) Johnson] born September 2, 1950. In Scott’s words: My service is much shorter: Enlisted in
the US Air Force Aug. 1974, went through basic training at Lackland AFB (same squadron that my
father supervised in 1966). Left Lackland AFB in October of 74 to go to tech school at Chanute, Il. I
finished this school quickly and received orders to go to Nellis AFB Nevada and work avionics on the
F-111&#x27;s. This was a great assignment for a 20 year old (24 hour town so it did not matter what shift I
worked). I quickly formed a friendship with a supervisor and his wife that loved the outdoors. We went
climbing or caving every weekend. Got to know all the local areas and people that were interested in
these sports, and took many extended trips to areas that were restricted to NSS members only. In the
spring of 1976 the Air Force decided to move three wings. The aircraft from Nellis were to go the
Mountain Home, ID.; Mountain Home&#x27;s aircraft were to deploy to Lakenheath England, and the english
birds were to go to Nellis. This was the largest peace time movement of aircraft and personnel at the
time. I was selected to go to England and arrived with the first group in April of 1977. What a mess; the
base was old (WWII) vintage buildings that serviced the B-17&#x27;s of the eighth Air Force during the war.
They were not set-up to handle 24 hour a day operations and did not have the experience or logistics in
place to support us. We spent the entire first year on weekly alerts to prove to NATO that we could
support their mission. Anyway, the base was lousy, the food was lousy, the barracks were lousy, but, the
side trips into England, Wales, and Scotland were worth the trip. I spent every free moment I could get
away from the base site seeing. I rotated out in July of 1978 and was discharged from McGuire AFB,
New Jersey on terminal leave. Scott is the provider of this twig of the Tree - thanks Scott. Born to
them were:</div>
