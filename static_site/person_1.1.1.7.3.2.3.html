Brooklyn Eagle, September 27, 1886: There were no bats flying through the halls of the Flatbush Lunatic Asylum when an
EAGLE reporter called there. On the beautifully kept grounds in front of the main building were a dozen men mowing the
grass and weeding the flower plots. The grand cluster of elms, maples and chestnut trees caught the fresh, cool breeze and
their branches, bowing in the bright sunlight, fanned the sad faces that were clustered at the grated windows above. There
was an atmosphere of quiet, even contentment, about the place which was only occasionally broken by the wild laugh,
weird chant or greeting of the inmates above. The thermometer man, a genial, pleasant faced, country philosopher looking
individual, wearing a tin badge upon his expansive breast, a big straw hat on his equally big head and carrying a stick, was
the first to accost the EAGLE man. The thermometer man had much to say about the incalculable blessings conferred upon
mankind by that valuable instrument. By a close study of the thermometer a man could, according to him, avoid all ills, as
he could at any moment know when to put on flannels or dress in thinner material. An attendant had, however, watched the
silver tube admirer, and gently led him away, and when last seen the thermometer was hanging to a nail in a tree and its
variations being marked with childish exultation by its owner. The attendant having learned the EAGLE man’s business
directed him to Dr. Shaw’s office, in the main building. During this brief space the dozen men – all insane – who had been
at work on the laws and flower beds had stopped work and stared at the reporter. Some bowed, some laughed, some looked
at him with a vacant air in which indescribable sadness prevailed. The Flatbush Lunatic Asylum, with all its alleged internal
miseries and abuses, is certainly a pleasanter place, viewed from the outside, that the cold, white stoned, severe building on

Ward’s Island, with no trees or flowering shrubs around it or miles of country scenery – nothing but the dreary, never
changing flow of the East River. Dr. Shaw having gone to St. Johnland, his assistant, Dr. Ferris, received the reporter. Dr.
Ferris is a broad shouldered, athletic man, of a courteous, kindly disposition and frank in manner. &quot;Dr. Ferris,&quot; said the
reporter, &quot;we are informed that the asylum is very much overcrowded, and the EAGLE desires to lay before its readers a
plain, truthful account of the present condition of the institution?&quot; &quot;I will afford the EAGLE every information that lies in
my power,&quot; replied Dr. Ferris. &quot;To begin with let me say, that this building when constructed was planned to contain as a
maximum 800 patients. Today we have 613 men and 870 women under our care, not including 56 patients who are now at
St. Johnland. Making a total of 1,539 patients to be provided for, where there was originally to be intended to be but 800. So
today we have 1,433 patients in our care to be literally packed in a space constructed to hold 800. To watch over these we
have only five doctors, fifty-nine male and sixty female nurses. That means that every female nurse has over one hundred
patients to attend to, and those familiar with the treatment of insane persons must know what a terrible responsibility that is.
So with the male nurses. They, as the figures show, have 100 patients each to look after. The pay of the nurses is but from
$14 to $20 a month and their hours of duty from 6 in the morning until 7:30 at night. No wonder the nurses are leaving us
all the time and that is is almost impossible to keep good, experienced ones, although I will say that we have some excellent
male and female nurses with us today. But to cap all this we are now obliged, for want of appropriations, to keep and feed
this vast army of insane patients at the most incredible sum of 92 cents per capita per week. Of course, we endeavor to get
the best we can, but what can be expected to be had for three meals a day at 13 cents per person?&quot; &quot;Insanity,&quot; added Dr.
Ferris, &quot;is one of those terrible diseases where the patient of the milder form suffers a thousand times more by being
compelled to associate with the more violent inmate. In our present overcrowded condition Dr. Shaw, with his assistants,
has endeavored to classify the different forms of dementia and thus keep as near as possible together the patients suffering
from almost similar forms of this awful disease. But come, now,&quot; said the doctor, &quot;and see for yourself how we are
situated.&quot; Dr. Ferris did not seize, as a morning contemporary so tragically describes, a bunch of keys that dangled from an
iron chain. He merely took a peculiarly shaped steel key from his pocket. This key remarked to the reporter is the open
sesame of the whole institution. Each nurse and watchman has one and all the locks are alike. &quot;I am afraid,&quot; remarked Dr.
Ferris, laughing, &quot;that the New York reporter who saw streams water trickling through the sodden walls; bats flying through
the halls and watchmen carrying bunches of keys, must certainly have, to speak vulgarly, had the bats. I will begin by
showing you the worst part of this institution. I will take you into the basement wards, where the troglodyte patients are
kept.&quot; Down two flights of steps the reporter followed the doctor. A strong, thick, wooden door, that swung noiselessly upon
its hinges, was opened, and as it closed the reporter found himself in a long corridor, at least three feet below the level of the
ground. This place has been condemned by grand juries, physicians, visitors and others, but owing to the overcrowded
condition of the institution what was originally intended as collars, store rooms, wash houses, and other work rooms, is now
the abode of that class of insane persons which the doctor classified as the living dead. Sitting on rude benches in corners
were men suffering from the worst forms of paresis. With drooping head, powerless limbs, glassy eyes staring into vacancy,
devoid of all feeling and sense, moving when moved; hardly able to eat, going to bed when led there, friendless, nameless,
dead in life, each were the companion of the unfortunate McCarthy, for whose death through alleged gross negligence
Keeper Charles D. T. Edgerton is now awaiting trial. &quot;Here is the bathtub in which that unfortunate occurrence took place,&quot;
said Dr. Ferris. &quot;There is no one regrets it more than I do, but I must say this for Edgarton that a better, kinder and more
patient nurse I have rarely met with than he was. He had been twice discharged previously for being under the influence of
drink, but that day I am positive he was sober. The class of patients to which McCarthy belonged are so utterly helpless that
it would be revolting to describe their habits. Yet Edgarton had this entire ward to attend to. He had to dress, wash, feed and
watch over them, and I know the man too well to believe that he had the water turned on too hot. While his attention was
called away, after putting McCarthy in the bath, it is not improbable that some patient, in a mad freak, turned on the hot
water, and the poor paralytic, unable to help himself, met with this terrible death. As an instance of the sudden strange
freaks of these demented persons, I may mention that two days ago one of our quietest patients sat at table. In front of her
was another patient belonging to another ward. In a moment, without even giving the attending nurses the least cause of
suspicion, this patient hurled a cap of hot tea in the other’s face. Of course she was quickly subdued, the nurses taking her
away. But for the thorough discipline of the nurses there might have been trouble in a room where 250 mad women were
huddled together at dinner, with only ten sane women to watch over them, and at the same time act as waitresses.&quot; In this
living tomb the reporter saw, both in the mail and female departments, the saddest and most painful forms of dementia. In
the men’s wards were the epilopiles, crouching low, with that awful look of dread about them, as if waiting with affright the
coming of another fit which would crush them in all its horrid tortures at an unexpected moment. Sixteen beds were

stretched upon the stone floor of a bin that would hardly serve six. &quot;We have to put these beds on the floor,&quot; said Dr. Ferris,
&quot;because at night these patients are frequently taken with fits and roll off. If the beds were raised they might strike their
heads on the stone floor and kill themselves before discovered by one of the three night watchmen, who alone are employed
to make the tours of this institution.&quot; A tall powerful negro walked up and down the corridor, heeding nobody. A thin, worn
out, cadaverous man sat sobbing to himself alone. A slim built, overgrown, unshapely young man, with a baby sized head
and an immense mouth, sat opposite the man who sobbed, and kept continually laughing, as an infant would when nursed.
Further on a man with a most woebegone expression dragged himself wearily along, turning around at every moment, as if
expecting some one who came not, and his face each time looked sadder than before. As with the men, so with the women,
only with the latter the sight was more painful and depressing. In one place sat a thin, haggard looking woman, whose face
was so pinched that the bones protruded. Her livid countenance, had a bluish tinge; her large deep set glassy eyes, her thin,
long gray hair, falling upon her shoulders, realized the startling picture of &quot;Death&quot; by Holbein. &quot;Now,&quot; said Dr. Ferris, &quot;let
me say one thing here. You see the walls are damp, but there are no streams of water trickling through them. We are
compelled by circumstances to use these underground vaults, but we keep them as well ventilated and dry as we can, and it
is ridiculous for any paper to publish that physicians would allow their reputations to be ruined by such unheard of cruelties
as we are accused of. Now let us go and see what we may term the harmless insane;&quot; and Doctor Ferris led the way up two
stories and with the same key opened the strong door that gave admittance to the various wards upon that floor. It was next
to impossible to find in some cases here any proof of insanity, so far as the expression and action of the patients went. A
young, good looking, intelligent man sat in one of the sunlit rooms reading a paper. As he saw the doctor he arose from his
chair and asked him to allow him to go to court, as he wanted to hear some cases tried…….. remainder of article

Brooklyn Eagle, May 1, 1888: Dr. G. Newton Ferris, medical superintendent of the Kings County Insane Asylum at
Flatbush, after over ten years connection with that institution, some time ago tendered his resignation, to take effect on May
1. The Commissioners of Charities and Corrections accepted the same with regret, as the services of the doctor were held in
high esteem. The nurses, both male and femal, in the institution ever which he had charge, in order to show their high
appreciation of him, adopted at a meeting suitable resolutions of respect. A committee of ten was appointed to have the
same engrossed and presented to the doctor. Dr. Shanks, of the asylum who succeeds the retiring superintendent, in behalf of
the committee presented the resolutions. Set in the center was the portrait of Dr. Ferris. The committee and Dr. Shanks were
seated in a room near the office of the asylum and a messenger was dispatched to Dr. Ferris announcing that his presence
was needed. In a few minutes he arrived. Dr. Shanks, in a few appropriate remarks, thanked Dr. Ferris on behalf of the
nurses of the institution for his kindness in the past and presented the resolution to him. The doctor responded briefly,
thanking his old helpmates for their token of esteem. The resolutions and accompanying preamble are as follows:
Whereas, G. Newton Ferris, M.D., has resigned the position of superintendent of this institution, therefore
Resolved, That in his retirement we tender him our sincere thanks for the many kindnesses experienced at his hands while in
management of this institution. He has won for himself, by h is uniform courtesy, considerate kindness and impartial
treatment the respect and friendship of those who hand the honor of serving under him.
Resolved, That in his new departure we wish h im every possible blessing and success, and we doubt not but those who will
have the honor to associate with him will soon learn to appreciate his sterling qualities as we have.
Resolved, That these resolutions be suitably engrossed and presented him as a token of the respect and admiration we have
for h im as an official and a gentleman. The Committee. After the presentation a dance was given to the patients, after which
the retiring superintendent received the well wishes of all the employees on his new undertaking.
Presume this is same fella – Brooklyn Eagle, December 30, 1901: Thomas Connors, 45 years old, a well known resident of
Flatbush, who resided at 3 Canton avenue, was taken suddenly ill yesterday morning and started for the office of Dr.
Newton G. Ferris at 910 Flatbush avenue. When Dr. Ferris opened his front door at 7:30 o’clock he found the dead body of
Connors on his front stoop and an investigation showed that life had been extinct for perhaps a half hour. The body was
taken to the Grant street police station and afterward removed to the Caton avenue residence on permission of the coroner.
Mr. Connors had always lived in Flatbush and for the past fourteen years had been in the employ of the Rev. Dr. Cornelius L
Wells of the Flatbush Reformed Church.
