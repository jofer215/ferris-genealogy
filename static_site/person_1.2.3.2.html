            <div class="person-text">(1.2.3.2) NATHANIEL UNDERHILL born August 31, 1723; married Ann Honeywell
[dau of Israel &amp; Dorothy] (1719-1782) who apparently died before Nathaniel as she was
not mentioned in will – apparently no offspring; 1759 he was one of the Judges of the
Court of the Common Pleas, for the County of Westchester and in 1775 was elected
Mayor of the Borough of Westchester; a Loyalist during the Rev War and arrested as
such. He made his will March 29, 1783, which was proven February 13, 1784; and is
recorded in New York Published Wills, Vol. 12, pp. 182-83. No wife is named, but he
married Ann, daughter of Israel H and Dorothy (Pell) Honeywell and she died
September 4, 1782 aged 63 years, leaving no issue. He divided his lands in Westchester
and elsewhere equally between Thomas McLeroth and Anthony Lispenard Underhill,
“son of my brother Israel.” He also gave the said Thomas one-half of his household
furniture, a negro woman and her child and one-half his sloop Tamer, but in
consideration of these bequests, “said Thomas must pay Nathaniel’s sisters, Helena
Morgan and Mary Bayley, certain sums.” To his nephew, Anthony Lispenard Underhill,
he bequeaths three negro men slaves, with all stock of cattle, horses, etc., but he is to pay

“my brother Bartow” 500 pounds, and “my nephew Nathaniel, son of John,” 200
pounds; a negro girl to Glorianna Underhill; to Sarah, wife of Samuel Embree, 100
pounds; to Mary, widow of John Bugbee, 50 pounds; to Amelia Wright, daughter of
Obadiah Purdy, and to Charity Dally, daughter of Joshua Hunt, 25 pounds each; to John
and Benjamin Underhill, sons of John, and to nephews, Obadiah and Joseph Purdy, 50
pounds each; negro slaves Abraham, Phyllys and Peggy, their freedom; codicil not
dated, mentions Gilbert Drake, son of sister Elizabeth, and Anner, daughter of brother
John, and requests that the slave Peggy, to whom he had willed her freedom, be sold
instead for behaving “contrary to the rule of a good servant.”</div>
