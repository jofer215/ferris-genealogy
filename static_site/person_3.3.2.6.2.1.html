            <div class="person-text">(3.3.2.6.2.1) ANGELINE FERRIS born 1808 Putnam Co NY and died 1831 Tyrone NY; married
1825 in Steuben Co, Jonathan L. Wolverton.
Tyrone Township, Livingston Co MI (1880)
Jonathan L. Wolverton was for many years one of the prominent men of the town. He came, in the spring of 1837, from the
town of Tyrone, Schuyler Co., N.Y., and settled on the southeast quarter of section 7, where he built a house a few rods west
of the section corner. For many years the corners and school-house located there bore his name, and it is not now by any
means obsolete. In politics he was a Democrat, and this agreeing with the sentiment of the majority in the town he was
frequently called to official positions. He was one of the first Justices of the peace, and held the office for a period of nine
years, being re-elected in 1839 and in 1843. He was also overseer of the poor for a number of years. About fourteen years
ago he sold his farm and moved to Fenton. Five or six years later, having unfortunately lost his property, he went to Ingham
County, where he is now living with, his son Lewis. Two of his sons --Sylvanus and Andrew J.--are still residents of Tyrone.
