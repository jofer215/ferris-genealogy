in Benton Harbor to Close: The closing of a Dean Specialty Foods plant this year marks the end of a
119-years history of making canned food products in this city. The company has decided to get out of
the diet and nutritional drink business, and the Benton Harbor plant was its only one making those
products. Including some employees who already were laid off, 93 people will lose their jobs. …….

under the name of C. H. Godfrey’s Canning Works. In 1927, what was then Godfrey Packing Co
merged with canning companies in South Haven and Fennville to form Michigan Fruit Canners, Inc.
New owners of Michigan Fruit Canners came on board in 1962 and 1974. The company’s name was
