            <div class="person-text">(3.1.2.1.11.5.1) NANCY D. FERRIS born October 16, 1820 Roxbury, Delaware, NY and died there
January 3, 1848; buried Old Cemetery near Methodist Church, Grand Gorge, Delaware Co; married
December 26, 1841 Taylor More [son of John L. &amp; Anna (Gould)] born January 3, 1820 Roxbury NY
and died February 2, 1879 Deposit NY; Taylor remarried and had children from that union; Taylor was
admitted to the bar as an attorney and counselor of the Supreme Court of the State of New York July
13, 1852, and from the time of admission practiced his profession: first at Delhi NY, and afterward at
Deposit, until his death. In his profession, he was always careful and conscientious. If there was a
doubt in his mind as to the final result of a proposed litigation, he invariably discouraged the bringing
of suit - oftentimes to his own pecuniary loss. In morals it may be said, without flattery, that his life
was above reproach. His honesty, none who knew him questioned. He indulged his fancy in leisure
hours writing poems, both humorous and serious, but few of them ever appearing in print, or even
known of outside of his family. He was a strong believer in the old-fashioned, orthodox religion, yet
liberal toward those who did not agree with him on these subjects. The closing sentence of his will,
made in 1875, is cherished by his family, and is typical of his character. It is: ‘I hope and believe that
my children will cultivate kindly feelings toward each other; that they will be manly, just and true in all
relations, intercourse, business and duties of life; just to themselves and to all men; and their mother I
know they will not forget. God bless and keep you all--mother and children’; and born to Nancy and
Taylor were:</div>
