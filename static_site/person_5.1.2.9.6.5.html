            <div class="person-text">(5.1.2.9.6.5) HARRIET CHAPMAN born September 5, 1818 Crofts Corners, Putnam County and died
January 1, 1916 at the home her niece in Peekskill, in her 98th year; married 1868 (April 1867), as his
2d wife, Stephen Curry [son of Thomas] born September 18, 1804 and died June 21, 1886 at his home
near Van Cortlandtville; both buried Hillside Cemetery, Peekskill. Harriet was descended from
Revolutionary parentage; one of her grandparents, Jeremiah Chapman, was an officer in the Colonial
Army, serving in the Connecticut Militia in the Davis Haight Company and the Charles Smith
Company. Another grandfather, Philemon Smith, was also a Revolutionary soldier. Harriet lived at the
homestead until 1868 (age 50?), when she married Stephen. She was of a generous temperament and
made friends wherever she went. She was a good hostess and always willing to entertain in her genial
manner. Stephen was a farmer all his life. He purchased a farm, which he occupied and owned up to the
time of his death. No offspring.</div>
