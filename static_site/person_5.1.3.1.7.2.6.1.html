            <div class="person-text">(5.1.3.1.7.2.6.1) MARY S. BURLINGAME (Photo) born June 26, 1842 Newbury, Geauga, OH and
died November 9, 1926; received a common school education, besides her two terms of select school in
Kent and one term at Streetsboro; married May 21, 1862 in Philadelphia PA, on what was after the
Centennial ground, Oscar F. Haymaker [son of James Davis &amp; Mary Rosetta (Olin) Haymaker] born
May 21, 1838 Franklin, Portage, OH and died May 4, 1907. Oscar was brought up on the old farm and
his early life was a rigid discipline of hard work. The old brick schoolhouse in the district witnessed his
early struggles to fill his mind with educational ideas. Three or four months of a winter term, each year,
at the district school, with two terms of select school in the village, then called Franklin Mills, filled the
measure of his school advantages to the time he was 18, when he taught his first term of school. He
continued teaching winters for thirty consecutive years, with the exception of the years 1879-80, when
he and wife held the positions of steward and matron of Buchtel College, Akron OH. Fourteen terms he
taught in his home district of Earlville, the school varying from 60 to 30 scholars. The Kent Union
School and the Streetsboro township high school were embraced in his teaching, besides the district
schools in the vicinity of his home. From his universal success as teacher he received the sobriquet of
Old Reliable. He remained on the farm with his father until he was 24, his father paying him wages
after he was of age. In the spring of 1862, in company with his brother-in-law, Stephen H. Green, he
began working a farm of 160 acres, which they had bought during the winter. After their marriage, they
lived on the farm until the spring of 1866 when they sold out, and then moved on to his father&#x27;s farm,

which he worked on shares for 3 years; then purchased a farm on 158 acres in the north part of
Franklin, to which he added 28 more acres. Oscar was engaged for 14 years as a member of the
Portage County Board of School Examiners, and retired, of his own accord, at the close of his last term,
August 31, 1890. Twice he served his township as Assessor and was President of the Portage County
Horticulultural Society; and was also the President of the Portage County Farmer&#x27;s Institute. In the fall
of 1890 he was elected as County Commissioner. They were members of the Universalist Church of
Kent. He belonged to F. &amp; A.M and was a Republican. Born to them were [adopted one son, Edward C.
Haymaker]:</div>
