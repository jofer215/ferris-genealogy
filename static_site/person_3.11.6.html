(3.1.1.3.1.4.10.6.6.2) Jane Lynn (Hornby) Fox
AI grew up in Welch, WVA. At our home at 403 Stewart St. We moved there when I was about 5
years old from a house on Riverside Drive in Welch. The subject of genealogy was occasionally
discussed and my father took us on trips to Basking Ridge NJ and to Cross River NY to visit his family.

Genealogy began in earnest for me in January, 1991. We had discovered that Grady, our third grandson,
was severely hearing impaired. I decided to find out if any others in our families had been similarly
afflicted. Nothing came to light, but by that time I was hooked.
At an early age I was interested in singing. My mother was the director of our youth choir at the
Anderson Memorial Chapel. Naturally her children were in the choir, but I took it very seriously and
learned from her some basic techniques in voice. Later we started attending the First Presbyterian
Church downtown. There, the choir director was an accomplished and trained soprano. Her further
instruction only increased my interest in singing. By the time I got to High School, I had already been
singing for several years and had often been given soloist roles in the church choirs.
In High School, I was a member of the A Cappella Choir for four years and took private singing
lessons from the School choir director, Mrs. Stevenson. By this time I was singing in the Presbyterian
Church Senior Choir. In school, I was usually selected to sing the solo parts and occasionally took a
solo part in the church choir.
High School was a very positive time for me. I was a member of every extra curricular club I
could possibly join. I was, at the time, a member of the Future Teachers of America and the Future
Nurses of America. These were mainly things to do during the lunch period, but my membership in the
Thespians was very serious. I was just in about every play that the school produced during my high
school years. If I wasn=t in one, it was only because I was already in another. I often had the lead
roles. In the polling at the end of our senior year, I was voted, along with three other of my classmates,
most talented.
In 1958, I represented the local Garden Club as an attendant to the Welch, WVA Bi-Centennial
Celebration. Also that year, I represented Welch High School in the West Virginia State Chorus. After
graduation our sorority took a trip to Myrtle Beach SC, for one week and in early June, 1958, I went
with my sister, Barbara, to Lakeville, Connecticut to a job at a summer resort there, the Interlaken
(pronounced &gt;Interlocken=) Inn. The Inn was owned and operated by the Peters= brothers, one of
whom was Leon Peters, the President of Cushman, Wakefield, a large real estate company in New York
City. Leon later became the owner of a racehorse, ACosta del Sol@, that won the Kentucky Derby
around 1985.
The Peters= family spent summers at Manaloking Beach in New Jersey. There, they met the
Fox family who also summered there. Through them, Richard obtained a summer job at Interlaken Inn
in 1958. He arrived at the Inn about June 15th. We met, dated, got pinned and then went back to our
respective homes when school began for us both inn early September. We wrote throughout the year
and saw each other only once - at Christmas time when Richard came to Welch for a visit.
The next summer, I returned to Lakeville to work again at the Inn. Richard had, in the
meantime, decided to work for the summer at Macy=s Department store near his home. His father was
a buyer at the main store in New York City. Every weekend Richard traveled to Connecticut to see me.
In July, he bought me a ring and asked me to marry him. I said yes. That September we again went
back to school, Rich as a senior at Brown University, me as a sophomore at Marshall University in
Huntington, WVA.
In October of that year, as a late birthday present, Richard came to see me. We had been
discussing our wedding plans by phone and letter for the past month. My parents were against a
marriage at any time in the near future. In fact the admonition was that not only should Richard and I

finish school, but Richard should finish graduate school and have a job in order to support me and any
family which was sure to come along. To us this was ages away. We decided that week on October
20th, 1959, not to wait. We bought plane tickets and left for New York City. Six days later, on October
26, 1959 we were married in Millerton, New York, not far from Lakeville, Connecticut where we first
met. Bill Peters and his wife, Rowena, stood up for us. Richard=s best friend and classmate at
Brown, AGabby@ Hayes was his best man. I had just turned age 19. Ten months later, on August 25th,
1960, our son, Richard Frederick Fox born. I was a month and 11 days short of my 20th birthday.
My singing career continued when we moved to Saxton=s River in 1961 when I joined the
Congregational Church Choir, joined a local Strings Orchestra and became a member of the Marlboro
Music Festival at Marlboro College, Marlboro, Vermont.
The orchestra and chorus was directed by Blanch Moyse (pronounced Moe-ese=) a colleague
of Rudolf Serkin and the wife of Marcel Moyse, all co-founders of the Marlboro Music Festival along
with Adolf Busch and his brother, Herman. Many of the performances of the Marlboro Music Festival
are still available on records and some are available on Compact Discs. I remained with the Chorus
until 1968 when we moved to Plainfield NH. There I joined the many choruses in Hanover NH include
the Handle Society.
Singing, acting in local Thespians groups, volunteering my time in the church, Boy Scouts and
Girl Scouts, along with raising my family became my career. I worked part-time selling Avon Products;
as a desk clerk at the Old Grafton Tavern, Grafton VT; receptionist for the William Jewett Tucker
Foundation at Dartmouth College, and Volunteer Coordinator for the Upper Valley R.S.V.P. program in
Lebanon NH.
In 1976 these activities came to an end when we moved to Gambier, Ohio where I was most
unhappy. After a year we moved back to the east coast and I took a full time job as Securities Cashier
at Cummings and Co., a brokerage firm in Providence, RI. One year later we moved to Groton,
Massachusetts. I continued my job in Providence for a time, but later went to work as the Secretary to
the Headmaster at Applewild School in Fitchburg MA. The job was overwhelming and I left to sell
Life Insurance with John Hancock. I later learned that the school hired 3 people to replace my position
and they now have five people doing the various jobs that I was responsible for. Selling life insurance
was not my favorite job either. I learned a lot about ripping people off, especially the old and/or poor.
My last job was as a researcher with the Development Office at Groton School. That job lasted
until Richard went on his Sabbatical in 1989. In January, 1992, after we learned that Grady was deaf, I
decided to pursue Genealogy.
Genealogy continues to be my chosen career. And while it brings no salary, it brings great
satisfaction. I have written a few articles for the Reynolds Family Association=s
publication, AReynolds Recollections@. Another article, written this past spring for the New England
Historic Genealogical Society, was not published. I learned from them that one of my principal
sources, Anjou Gustave, is well-known for his fraudulent genealogies.
On December 7, 1994, I was admitted as a member of the D.A.R. under Lt. Nathaniel Reynolds
of New York. At the present time I am a member of the White Mountains Chapter in Littleton NH. My
national number is 762340 and elected as Chapter Regent, Fall of 1995.

RICHARD KEITH FOX: Richard graduated from Summit High School, (NJ) in 1956. In his youth he
was an aspiring dancer and taught dancing with Jessie Dotterer at the Hobby Hall Dance Studios. He
received his B.A. from Brown University, 1960 and his M. Ed. at Antioch College in 1971 and received
his certification as a secondary school principal. He was a member of the faculty at Vermont Academy,
Saxtons River, VT 1961-64, coached hockey and basketball and served on several committees. He
joined Campbell Films, Inc., in Saxtons River VT in 1964, where among other enterprises, on the 100th
anniversary of her birthday, Richard produced a film documenting the life of Anne Sullivan Macy,
teacher of Helen Keller. After two years or so, Rich was selected to be the Director of SEVCA, the
Southeastern Vermont Community Action Program, one of President Kennedy=s special projects. He
said goodby to Bob Campbell and that crew, and opened up his offices in Bellows Falls, Vermont. We
continued to live on Pleasant Street in Saxtons River. Our house was directly across the street f rom the
Campbell family with their 11 children.
In 1967 Richard went to Dartmouth College, Hanover NH as Assistant Dean for Development,
Executive Officer of the William Jewett Tucker Foundation, Director of Peace Training and Lecturer in
Education. During this time his job took him to Jersey City, NJ; Talladega, AL; and Clarksdale MS.
As a member of the Education Department he was faculty advisor to several Dartmouth
students who were assistant teachers in low income and depressed areas. Dartmouth College was one
of several sites for Peace Corps Training. Richard=s responsibilities took him to St. Anne, de La
Pocatiere and other villages in the Province of Quebec, Canada. His training of Peace Corps teachers
of English as a Foreign Language took him to French West Africa; The Ivory Coast, Chad, Dahomey,
Niger, Senegal, and Togo. In 1974 he became Director of Development of the Dartmouth College
Medical School.
In the summer of 1976 the family moved to Gambier OH, where Richard joined the
administration of Kenyon College as Vice President for Development. We stayed there only one year,
being very homesick for the East Coast.
The next move, in the summer of 1977, brought the family to Barrington, R.I., where Richard
was Associate Director of Development at Brown University, Providence RI. We were members of the
Barrington Yacht Club, and became interested in sailing. We bought a 21&#x27; Catalina, which slept
4 &gt;uncomfortably.= Soon after we moved up to a 26&#x27; Pearson, which we named ATrifle@.
In 1978, the family again moved (sigh!). This time to Groton, Massachusetts where Richard
took over as Director of Alumni Affairs and Development. In the past 17 years, Groton, under his
guidance, has increased its endowment from $15 million to its present $102 million. He has increased
the staff of the Alumni and Development from 5 to 13. The office has taken on several projects. Some
of these are new, like the AGroton Face Book@ with pictures of every student, faculty member and
staff member. Established projects, like the Groton Yearbook, were assigned to his office several years
ago and more recently the responsibility for the Groton Quarterly was given to him as well. His office
has the reputation of being the most professional, the most effective, the most dedicated, and the
hardest working office at the School. Rich=s accomplishments in Educational Fundraising, as well as
at the World Wildlife Foundation, are recognized nationwide, and to some degree, worldwide. He is
now listed in AWho=s Who in the East@ and in AWho=s Who in Education@.
Over the years, Richard has served in various community capacities: 1964, Mayor and First
Trustee, Saxtons River VT; 1967, Selectman, Town of Rockingham VT (including Saxtons River,

Bellows Falls, Gageville, etc.); 1974, 1st President, United Way of the Upper Valley, Lebanon NH. In
1989 he became the fundraising consultant to the World Wildlife Fund and Conservation Foundation
and in 1990 a WWF
National Council Member. He is a member of the Planned Giving Group of New England. He has
contributed articles to CASE conference publications and other professional journals in the field of
fund raising. He has been a consultant for development offices in other not-for-profit schools and
organizations. While he works out of Groton MA, his home is Lancaster. He likes to travel and has
been to Africa, France, England, Canada and most of the 49 states. His travels in 1995 took him again
to England and then to Greece.
After we first moved to Groton School we bought 26 acres of land in Lancaster NH. Here an 8&#x27;
x 12&#x27; bunk house was built by Richard and sons, Rich and Robb. In 1983, a 16&#x27; x 32&#x27; log cabin was
constructed. This served as home until 1987 when the cabin was moved 150 yards to the southwest
and a permanent two-story, three bedroom, frame house was built on the site of the cabin with
spectacular views of the White Mountains. Later an in ground pool, 18&#x27;x38&#x27;, was constructed.
Improvement to the property is an ongoing project; removing trees, clearing land, building stone walls
(a big project of Rich and Cindy=s in the summer of 1993) planting shrubs and flowers as well as
building a road to the house and, the latest project, a 4 bay, timber peg garage for the cars, tractor and
lawn mowers.
Properties owned have included a home on Pleasant Street in Saxtons River VT; on River Road
in Plainfield NH; on 20 Valley Road in Hanover NH; at 112 Allen Drive in Gambier OH; at 46
Rumstick Road in Barrington RI; and finally on Garland Road in Lancaster NH@. [Jim - in 1996, the
Foxes sold AFOXWOLD@ in Lancaster and bought a &gt;new= home (185+ years old) in the southern
climes of NH at Amherst. Their spare time is filled by studying old homes and designing kitchens and
baths.]

containing 10,530 acres. A settlement was commenced here in 1770 by John Pangborn and Odle
Squire, from Cornwall, Conn., who were soon joined by Timothy Spaulding and others from the same
place and by Peter Ferris from Nine Partners, N.Y. ...... The settlers returned after the War and in 1784
the town was organized, Elijah Grady was the first town clerk and Peter Ferris was first representative,
chose in 1787.

Numerous folks in this chapter are buried at the Mt. Carmel Baptist Church Cemetery {now called
the Sycamore Township Memorial Cemetery}, Hamilton County OH. Myron B. Stevens, Sr. was
kind enough to provide a copy of a pamphlet from the dedication ceremony conducted, November 24,
1991. The history of this cemetery is provided below:
The Mount Carmel Cemetery is located on Kenwood Road in Sycamore Township, Hamilton
County, Ohio. The cemetery and the Mount Carmel Baptist Church that once stood in the middle of it
were established in 1823 on an acre of land donated to the church by Adam Lee, a church member and
trustee. Lee was an early settler of Sycamore Township who purchased the entire section, 640 acres, in
1797 from the original patent holder, John Cleves Symmes (Hamilton County Deed Book B2:35).
Mount Carmel Baptist Church was organized on July 20, 1822, with a moderator, a clerk and
twenty-five original members including John, Isaac, and Enoch Ferris, Matthias Felter and Adam Lee.
The Mount Carmel congregation grew rapidly, out-numbering the much earlier Carpenter=s Run
Baptist congregation at the Blue Ash Meeting House which had been founded in 1797. The
Carpenter=s Run society dissolved in 1828 after repeated internal disputes (Nelson and Runk
1894:453). An 1881 source averred that the AMount Carmel Church, whose meetinghouse is not far
south of the Carpenter=s Run site, long since superseded the pioneer society@ (Ford and Ford
1881:391).
Less than a year after the formation of the Mount Carmel Baptist society, member Adam Lee
conveyed a one-acre parcel to the Trustees of the Mount Carmel Church, who were Andrew Hammel,
John Ferris, and Adam Lee. On March 15, 1823, Lee stipulated in the indenture that if the one-acre
parcel was not used as a Aplace of public worship and religious education or a burying ground,@ the
agreement of conveyance would be void (Hamilton County Deed Book 23:9).
Lee provided a clear impetus in his deed of gift for the new congregation to build a sanctuary
and establish a cemetery immediately, and it is likely that they did. The church building was brick, and
a late nineteenth century plat, which included a small sketch of the church, showed a gable front
building facing east towards modern Kenwood Road (Nelson 1894:453 and Hamilton County Plat
Book 9:19). A 1934 pen and ink drawing of the church by local artist Caroline Williams depicts a
single story gable front brick building with two front doors and four windows along the sides of the
small structure (Williams 1939:182, figure 2).
The orientation of the building facing Kenwood Road indicates that the structure was built after
the creation of the road. Indeed, this portion of Kenwood Road, first called Columbia Road, and later
Madison or Madisonville Road, was established by the Hamilton County Commissioners on August 29,
1820, at least three years before the construction of the church (Hamilton County Road Records,
Volume 2:88). It served as a major route from the northeastern part of the county to the Ohio River at
the village of Columbia, located at the mouth of the Little Miami River.
Evidence that the cemetery portion of Lee=s gift was put into immediate effect is in the early
marked burial of one of the founding member=s children. Cronymous Felter, the twelve year old son
of Matthias and Rebecca Felter, died on August 27, 1823, and was buried in the west central part of the
graveyard; his is the earliest marked grave in the cemetery. His mother, Rebecca, died in 1830 and was
buried near him.
Both the church and the cemetery remained active at this site until 1915 when the congregation
moved to a new church on Blue Ash Road. In 1941, the Board of Trustees of the Mount Carmel

Church Cemetery elected to transfer the title of the cemetery property and the responsibility for its
maintenance to the Trustees of Sycamore Township (Hamilton County Deed Book 1951:536).
The name was officially changed at the dedication ceremony, November 24, 1991.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Earhart Genealogy provided by Myron B. Stevens, Sr.
The George Earhart Family was among the first settlers in the Little Miami Valley, having made their
journey from New London Cross Roads, Chester PA. A son, Samuel, born January 22, 1794 in PA and
came as a child of four to Indian Hill. In 1820, Samuel married Priscilla Armstrong, daughter of the
donor of the land upon which Armstrong Chapel was built, uniting two pioneer families. Their 4th
child was Alasanna born September 23, 1815 and on August 14, 1834, she married Lot Losh of Losh=s
Run Corners PA.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Losh Genealogy provided by Myron B. Stevens, Sr.
Lot Losh came to Indian Hill in 1825 from Losh’s Run Corners PA; born July 9, 1811 and married,
1834, Alasanna Earhart.
Re Duck Creek Cemetery, Hamilton Co OH – Duck Creek Baptist Church and its cemetery, by 1900,
was abandoned and the cemetery devasted. That church moved and became Hyde Park Baptist Church,
without a cemetery on the grounds. The area where the church and cemetery were have been cleared
for commercial development. I-71 now courses through the grounds – several graves were moved, but
destination unk currently (2007).
