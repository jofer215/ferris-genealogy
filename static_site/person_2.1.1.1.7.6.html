            <div class="person-text">(2.1.1.1.7.6) JOHN LELAND WEBB born February 25, 1794 (NY) Fairfield Co CT and died October
17, 1846 Towanda, Bradford Co PA; reared and educated in Fairfield Co; moved to Bradford Co PA to
begin his active business career and engaged in contracting and building; was one of the contractors of
the North Branch Canal in North Pennsylvania; lived in Ridgebury PA and is also stated to have lived
in Willsbury NY; a soldier in the War of 1812 as a Private in Captain Elijah Reed’s Company,
34th Regiment, commanded by Colonel Nehemiah Lockwood, September 8-13, 1813; a politician
(county commissioner, sheriff); married September 23, 1819 Annis Hammond [dau of Dudley of
Goshen NY] born March 30, 1799 Chemung Co NY and died September 7, 1871. “At his residence in
Smithfield, on the evening of the 17th inst., after illness of but a few hours, John Leland Webb, Esq.,
aged 52y 7m 22d. The loss of Mr Webb will be severly felt by the citizens of this county, as he long
held a high place in the estimation of the public. He emigrated to this county from one of the Eastern
States in early life, with nothing but an untiring energy, an uncompromising integrity, and a sound
discriminating judgement, to aid him in starting on the journey of life. By industry he succeeded in
acquiring a competency of worldly goods, and by his integrity and kindly disposition he won the
esteem and confidence of all who knew him. Mr. Webb has been called upon, by the suffrages of his
fellow-citizens, to fulfill various county offices, in all of which he gave entire satisfaction to his
constituents. In the fall of 1845, and again on the 13th of the present month – but four days before his
death – he was elected to a seat in our State Legislature.” Born to them were:</div>
