“I had a wonderful childhood on the farm at Coldwater Lake, MI. I shall always hold those
experiences near &amp; dear to my heart. I enjoyed being with Dad while he did the farm work. At dusk,
Dad always liked to go fishing whenever possible. He would use a 24&#x27; cane pole with 27&#x27; of line and a
big yellow fly. He would always come in with 2 or 3 big Bass (a great meal for the next day!!)
I went to the Quimby School, which was a rural one-room building with 8 grades and 1 teacher.
It was approximately 2 miles from the farm and in good weather I would walk to school and back

home. In the winter when there was a lot of snow and the road was impassable by car, Dad would
come and pick me up on the orange Allis Chalmers tractor.
Just yesterday (6/7/1995) I re-met Robert Massey, one of my playmates from the Coldwater
Lake Area. We had not seen each other for 52 years. He recalled how Dad would pick me up with the
tractor in bad weather.
When I was in the 6th grade we moved to Hall&#x27;s Corners and lived at my Grandfather &amp;
Grandmother Vance&#x27;s farm as they were getting too old to farm. We were there just one year and Dad
also had to quit farming due to health reasons. This is when we moved to Reading, MI.
We then moved to Jonesville, MI. where I graduated from high school. I went to Hillsdale
College and majored in music to become a public school band director. My major instrument was the
trumpet. My mother &amp; I both graduated from Hillsdale College the same year, 1957.
I held jobs in North Adams, Hudson, Dowagiac and Olivet (all in MI). After 30 years of
teaching I retired at the age of 50 in 1986 and began working 3 months of the year for Marshall Music
Co. of Lansing in 1989.
In 1957 Anne (Ginger) England and I were married and we had 3 children, Norman Scott
Vance, Darren Lee Vance, &amp; Tamara Lynn Vance. Tammy passed away when she was 13 months old.
We never quite fully recovered from her loss.
Ann England Vance and I were divorced in 1972; I then married Janet Ryan of Sand Lake,
Hillsdale, on Sept. 05, 1974 and divorced here in June of 1975, as she did not accept my children. I
could not tolerate this as Scott &amp; Darren had already been through enough heartbreak in their young
lives. Scott was living with me.
I met Mary Anne Saylor (Hayes) and we were married on June 10, 1977 and to the marriage she
brought a daughter, Trace Sue Hayes. Just after we were married, Darren came to live with us, too.
Mary Anne has been a great wife to me and also a super mother to the children. We bought a home in
Olivet where I was teaching and she continued to teach Kindergarten in Hillsdale for 2 years driving
100 miles daily. She finally was able to get a job in the Olivet school system. She is looking forward
to retirement in the near future.
During my lifetime I have also been involved with directing church choirs for many years,
being a member of the Barbershop Chorus in Hudson &amp; in Battle Creek, a member of 2 Barbershop
Quartets, directed the Hillsdale Sweet Adeline chorus, and have been judging at band contests
throughout the State of Michigan for 25 years.
Our Vance Reunion was rejuvenated in 1992 after an absence of many years. It is nice to get
together with the few Vance&#x27;s that remain today. It is a 3-day affair and is held at Cheryl Vance Down&#x27;s
home on the chain of lakes. It is sad to think that all the generations of our Vance name may possibly
come to an end and the traditions and memories will become lost. We must enjoy what we have
presently.
I enjoy working out regularly at the Oaklawn Life Improvement Center in Marshall to get back
in a little better physical condition and in summertime much time is spent in the boat which Scott &amp; I
own together. We keep it at my brother&#x27;s home on the chain of lakes. I continue to work for Marshall
Music Co of Lansing, MI. 3 months of the year fitting 5th graders to their band instruments for
beginning band.

Mary Anne and I enjoy our Olivet home. We are very proud of the accomplishments of our
children.”

The Ferris House, 3915 Plainville Road, Cincinnati OH 45227
Welcome To The Ferris House. Do you believe that spirits can cohabit in buildings with people
who are yet among the mortal? You do! Congratulations, you are visiting a postcolonial house where
such a spirit is in residence. Yes, the Ferris House has a resident spirit. The resident spirit is a lady in
her late twenties. She is the sole spirit resident. You won&#x27;t see her during your visit. Like all spirits,
she can be seen only on rare occasions and only when she believes she will not be observed. Time is of
no consequence to her. She moves about at all times of the day. She is vibrant and not above playing
little games with mortals in the building.
The Spirit&#x27;s Choice. The resident spirit is not a prisoner in the Ferris House. She lives here at
her own volition. She loves the Ferris House. Undoubtedly, she will live here until the Ferris House
passes from the earthly scene. The Ferris House is a beautiful structure. The resident spirit is
completely at home in the house. It was her earthly home during the early years of her life. The house
is little changed since she first lived here nearly 200 years ago. Oh, the furnishings have changed and
some changes were made in the hall, but otherwise it is the same home she knew while she was
growing up. Moving through the building for her is no problem, daylight or dark.
A Fun Loving Spirit. She is the only resident spirit in the building. Some spirits prefer to be
with their relatives or friends. Not her. As a mortal, she once was excluded from the house. Perhaps in
retaliation she now excludes other spirits. Whatever the reason, she resides here alone. On occasion
she will play tricks with Ferris House occupants. In some instances, some of the associates working for
the Institute have elected to work late hours in the evening. They report all manner of incidents. An
associate one evening heard soft footsteps coming up the steps from the front hall to the office where
she was working. She had the feeling that someone had stopped at the door and was watching her prior
to proceeding to the third floor. Another example included the report that as an associate talked on the
phone, she felt that something brushed against her and continued up the stairs. Late one evening an
associate was reading in the north room. The door between the north room and the central office was
closed; she was startled from her reading by loud banging on the interior door. When she opened the
door she found no one there. After closing the door and returning to her reading, the banging on the
door resumed. Again she checked but found no one. Another report was that an associate heard voices
in an adjacent room when there was no one else in the building. Even ESI associates working during
the day report that they have experienced strange happenings. One associate reported that while on the
stairs descending from the second floor, drops of water were sprinkled on her head. The incident
occurred when it was raining outside, but there were no areas of leakage in the building. It can be
assumed that the Ferris House resident spirit has many good laughs about the tricks she plays upon the
Ferris House mortal associates.

Early Mortal Days of the Resident Spirit. Recall that you are in a building nearly two centuries
old. Think of it - she born almost two hundred years ago. Can you imagine what life was like then?
This area was virgin forest country. Land had to be cleared before it could be farmed. Food was
preserved by the family, all members of the family contributed to family success. The beams in the
Ferris House were hewed from the trees that surrounded the spot where the Ferris House stands today.
The family of the resident spirit was rich in comparison with other farmers living in southwest Ohio
around 1800. Her father and uncle built the two largest farmhouses in this area. For more than 180
years, they were landmarks among the little houses on the prairie. Our resident spirit&#x27;s life was far less
harsh than that of her contemporaries. Life in the early 1800s left no doubt as to who headed the
family. Social life was male dominated. Without reservation, father knew best. Father had strong
ideas about family life. He established what was acceptable and what was not. This is not to say
father&#x27;s views were always acceptable to family members. Stronger willed family members tiring from
father&#x27;s dominance would pack their belongings and head west. For males, the decision to leave the
family homestead was traumatic. They faced arduous years ahead. For the daughter whose views
differed from those of her father, the decision was shattering. The male could leave and return to
demonstrate to the family the victories he had achieved and he was welcomed and congratulated. The
female often did not return of her own will or was barred from returning by an unforgiving father.
The Mortal Resident Spirit Leaves the Ferris House Never to Return. Eliphalet Ferris, a Godfearing man, reared his family in the Ferris House and was happy. But he couldn&#x27;t do all the work
himself and one day he hired a young German to assist him in the farm. The young man&#x27;s name was
Henry Baikley, but later he changed it to Beekley. Eliphalet Ferris had a daughter, Ann. A pretty girl
she was, young, full of life and dreams. After a while the family began to notice that Henry and Ann
were in love. Eliphalet Ferris didn&#x27;t seem to notice what was happening. Shortly thereafter, Henry and
Ann left home without informing any family members. After a while Ann wrote to her father. The
young couple had eloped to Indiana and made a home of their own. She begged her father&#x27;s
forgiveness for running away and hoped he would help them in building a home. But something had
gone out of Eliphalet Ferris= heart when his daughter ran away. He vowed he never again wanted to
see her. The years rolled by and Eliphalet Ferris kept his vow. First one baby and then another came to
the home of Ann and Henry until there were three boys and two girls, and all the time Ann waited for
her father&#x27;s forgiveness; but he wouldn&#x27;t grant it. Later Henry Beekley disappeared, leaving the young
woman alone. Her health was broken and the little family was almost destitute. She wrote again to her
father. Her sister, Phoebe Ferris, interceded for Ann, begging Eliphalet Ferris to forgive his daughter.
Eliphalet relented and built Ann a cabin a long way from the Ferris House. He also provided her with a
wagon and other necessities of life, but would never permit her to return to the Ferris House.
Postlude. While Ann Ferris Beekley was never permitted to return to the Ferris House as a
mortal, her love for the Ferris family and the Ferris House never abated. Hence, the stern father and/or
time were unable to prevent the return of Ann in spirit form. As evidence, two further incidents are
offered to confirm that the resident spirit inhabits the Ferris House to this date and forever after. It
was the habit of an ESI associate (Joh) to work until seven o&#x27;clock through the week and on Saturday
afternoons. At the time of this happening, a second associate always stopped by the Ferris House
conference room where John worked before leaving. One late afternoon, she stopped by as usual on

her way out; hollered, &#x27;I am locking the door&#x27;, and left. Within five minutes from the time she locked
the door, the door opened and John heard what he thought was the associate going up the stairs. After
about twenty minutes had elapsed, he realized that the associate hadn&#x27;t come back down the stairs. He
called to her and received no response. Immediately he went to the second floor and found no one. He
went up the steps to the third floor and found no one there either. Returning downstairs, he checked the
door; it was still locked. John asked the associate the next morning if she had returned after leaving the
previous evening. The response was negative. The resident spirit truly was playing a trick. John&#x27;s
second experience was much more vivid than the first, though he never will forget the footsteps on the
stairs. John had worked most of a Saturday afternoon at the Ferris House and for some unexplained
reason decided to take a short walk. Upon his return, the rays of the setting sun were shinning in
through the front hall windows. He glanced through the window as he started to open the door and
stood there spellbound. There she was. The resident spirit, as much alive as she ever must have been,
standing beside the table that is still in the front hall. She was arranging red roses, dressed in black
with a black hat on her head and wearing circa 1800 clothing. He had no idea how long he must have
been looking through the window, probably only a matter of seconds, when Ann Grooms arrived. John
turned to greet Dr. Grooms momentarily and then looked again into the hall. The resident spirit and the
roses were gone.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Henry B Dawson, husband of Catharine Martling (5.1.3.5.1.1.3)
The Historical and Genealogical Register. July, 1890. Henry B. Dawson by Rev. John A Todd, D.D., Tarrytown, N.Y.
On Thursday, May 23, 1889, surrounded by wife and children, the surviving loved ones of the household, there
passed away, from the ranks of the living, a man of marked and rare individuality, whose memory will be most tenderly
cherished by those who knew him best. That man was Henry B. Dawson. Although he had no clearly pronounced disease,
he had nevertheless been in failing health for a number of months, at least, if not indeed for several years, and at last the
body, worn and weary from long continued toil and incessant struggle with the storms of life, sank peacefully to its rest in
the sleep of death.
He was distinguished by several characteristics that put him in noticeable contrast with the common run of
human kind, but of those who have devoted themselves to historical investigation, at the sources of things, ad fonts rerum,
bringing to light new facts, or rather facts that had previously been overlooked or obscured, searching out and putting men
in possession of documents of unusual value, with all their wealth of suggestion to modify old opinions, and to clear up
what had before been dark or imperfectly understood, he ranked, as he deserved to rank, among the most conspicuous, and
the most useful in the land.
The labors of his life were immense, and no one can now go over the long list of works, productions, articles in
various forms, that he wrote, or edited and published, without being touched with almost a sense of weariness in view of the
research, the study, the thought, and the concentrated attention, to say nothing of the enormous physical effort, which they
must have required. He gave to the world over one hundred works, taking the greater and the smaller together, upon
different events and phases of our national and local history, and thus did as much, to say the least, as any man of his
generation to elucidate our colonial and revolutionary annuals
There was a peculiarity in his mind of the nature of genius, the geschicht-geist, which enabled him to discern,
and to explain to the bottom, the old documentary records, and the early traditions, whether written or unwritten, and this, in
connection, with his uncompromising loyalty to the truth, no matter whether it was adverse or favorable to friend or foe,
stamped him as a born investigator and historian. His persistence, too, when he once struck the trail of an important fact
bearing upon the judgment to be finally formed, was no less remarkable. He seemed to know that the fact was in existence
somewhere, as Columbus seemed to know that there was somewhere a new world beyond the western sea, and he could not
rest until he had found it. No expenditure of effort, or of pecuniary means compatible with his slender fortune – for like so
many others of his intellectual taste and ability he was far from being he possessor of wealth – ever daunted him in the
pursuit of his object. He was sure it was there, and rather than leave it there in continued and unprofitable concealment, he

was ready, like Hotspur in King Henry IV., to “Dive unto the bottom of the deep, Where fathom-line could never touch the
ground, And pluck up drowned honor by the locks.” And rarely did it happen that when he emerged from the search, he did
not bring the reward of his effort with him.
It is always a matter of interest to trace back to its small beginning anything that has grown to be important or
great. The springs of the Nile and the Orinoco have been sought with persistent energy by men because their grander
development farther on lends dignity to their obscure and distant sources. We go back from our present point of national
progress and power in this closing decade of the nineteenth century to the small settlements of the English at Jamestown, of
the Dutch at New York, and of the Pilgrims at Plymouth, in the early decades of the seventeenth, and the two points of
contrast mutually impart a more vivid interest to one another. So it is with men, who, by their character and labors, as
illustrated in what they have been and done, have impressed themselves strongly upon their fellows. The wish and the
instinct are to inquire into their origin, their early lives, and their successive advances toward the ultimate result in which
they became what they were, and accomplished what they did for their country or the world. It is a natural and laudable
impulse, and it cannot be doubted that many who have derived pleasure and profit from the labors of our departed friend
will be glad to know something of his personal history, or his spirit and of his daily life.
Henry Barton Dawson was born at Gosberton, one hundred and thirty-five miles north of London, on June 8,
1821. His birthplace was in the County of Lincoln, not far from the famous old town of Boston, one the eastern coast of
England. In the spring of 1834, when he was only about thirteen years old, his parents emigrated to the United States,
landing in the city of New York. They found a home in Manhattanville and Bloomingdale, then almost in the suburbs, and
here they continued to reside, Henry in the meantime living with them until, in the autumn of 1837, the family removed to
Ithaca, Tompkins County, New York.
Henry enjoyed good advantages of education in his native village across the water, and in the town of
Donnington, near by. After the removal to New York, except during the summer of 1835, he attended Public School No. 12
in West Seventeenth Street, and the village school at Manhattanville, until March, 1836, when he was withdrawn from
school in order to assist his father in his business of gardening. It indicated his quality as a student that the Trustees of the
Public School Society offered him, in recognition of his fidelity and unusual progress, a free scholarship in any of four
colleges which they designated; but this offer, gratifying as it was, the circumstances of his father did not allow him to
accept.
Henry continued to assist his father in the gardens at Manhattanville, Bloomingdale and Ithaca until 1838, when
he spent a short term of service with a wheelwright in Ithaca, and afterwards a similar term in a large publishing and bookselling house in the same village. The latter was most congenial to his tastes, and he greatly enjoyed the opportunity it
afforded of reading and becoming familiar with books. It was much against his own inclination, therefore, and quite as
much against the efforts of his employers to keep him, that he felt constrained to give it up. It seemed best, however, that he
should leave Ithaca in April, 1839, and return to New York city, as the confidential clerk and book keeper of a prominent but
aged resident of Ithaca, who was then removing to that city. With this gentleman first, and afterward with others, he
continued to occupy himself in the same capacity, sometimes acting in important business transactions, until the summer of
1847, when he withdrew from mercantile pursuits, to take the editorial and business control of The Crystal Fount and
Rechabile Recorder, a temperance and literary paper published in New York. He was obliged to take this step in order to
recover payment of a loan which he had made to the proprietor. In a few months, however, he found it necessary to
withdraw from this undertaking, with the loss not only of the original loan, but of all that was left of the entire savings of his
life. He was then engaged in the service of the International, and the American Art Unions, in each instance acting as its
agent in New York city, and with each, in succession, he continued to the close of its existence. Later he held the position of
Secretary of the builders and first proprietors of the Wall Street Ferry to Brooklyn, and then of Secretary successively to the
Beekman and to the Mechanics Fire Insurance Companies of New York. When the last-named company failed, through the
concealed misconduct of its President, in 1856, his business career as an employee of others in purely business lines was
brought to a final close.
During all the years of his childhood, youth and early manhood, Mr. Dawson had spent whatever time he could
control, including much which he took from the hours of his needed rest, in reading and study, especially on the subject of
theology, of the science of government, and of the history of our own country. He became ere long a contributor to the
press. As early as the spring of 1841, his occasional articles, generally on the political questions of the day, and always
anonymous, which were published in the New York daily newspapers, attracted no little attention. Three of these articles,

forming a series, based on the three sentences of President Harrison’s dying words, and sent without the author’s name to
one of the popular dailies, were used for the leading editorial articles on as many successive days. The notice taken of them
induced the editor to publish three times the request for the name and address of the writer. For some reason the requests
were not complied with, and the writer’s identity was never disclosed.
The peculiar character of his studies naturally led hi to a close observance of the politics and the politicians of
the day, not that he ever sought or even desired political preferment, but it was rather a study based on principle, and
growing as a duty out of the citizenship which he highly prized. In fact, before any of the political leaders of the city of New
York had made any public movement on the subject of “Free Soil,” in the summer of 1848 he wrote a call, and headed its
list of signers, for a public meeting to consider the subject, in the Ninth Ward, then one of the strongest Democratic wards in
the city. He was chosen Secretary of the very large meeting which assembled in response to that call, and it became historic
as the first “Free Soil” meeting held within the city during that eventful struggle. It belonged to the small beginnings of that
mighty conflict between Slavery and Freedom, which, but little more than a decade later, shook the continent, and
culminated in the Emancipation Proclamation and the surrender at Appomattox Court House that made Freedom national,
from the Lakes of the Gulf, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific waves.
He was associated with two of the oldest and most influential residents of the ward, and, with them, elected at
that public meeting to represent the ward in whatever General Committee of the party should be appointed by other wards.
Subsequently, with his honored and venerable associates, he took his seat as a delegate of the old Ninth Ward, in the General
Committee appointed to conduct that stirring campaign, and. With John Van Buren, Benjamin F. Butler, Samuel J. Tilden,
Lucius Robinson, David Dudley Field, John Cochrane, Alexander S. Johnson, Eugene Casserly, Wilson G. Hunt, William F.
Havemeyer, Chauncey Schaffer, and others of equal distinction, representing other wards, he continued to represent the
Ninth, which became the strongest “Free Soil” ward in the city, in that General Committee, as long as the separate
organization of the somewhat revolutionary party was maintained.
When his associates in the “Free Soil” party returned to the Democratic fold, he did not go with them,
notwithstanding he continued to claim that he was, what they had previously been, a “Democrat opposed to the present
administration.” Entertaining these views, he immediately united with others disaffected in forming the “Free Democratic
League,” an association whose principal object was to prevent the extension of Slavery into free territory, the purpose to
which the “Free Soil Party,” locally known as “The Barnburners,” had been nominally devoted. In the work of organizing
that “League” he was associated with the well-known Hon. John P. Hale and Minthorne Tompkins, veteran statesmen, for
the formation of the Platform and Constitution of the new body, and the original manuscript of that Platform and
Constitution, drawn up by himself, and slightly amended by the “League,” bearing the signatures of the venerable William
Jay, John Jay, John P. Hale, Minthorne Tompkins, Cornelius Vanderbilt, Hiram Barney and others, was still in Mr. Dawson’s
library at the time of his death. The Hon. John Jay, afterward American Minister at the Court of Austria-Hungary, was
President of the “League,” and Mr. Dawson was its Vice President, a position he continued to hold until the League was
superseded in its work by other organizations proceeding from itself, and was finally dissolved.
When the political conflict in Kansas became so conspicuous that the attention of the entire country was called
to it, he aided, in connection with John Jay and D.D.T. Marshall, in calling and organizing the three great meetings in the
city of New York, in which, successively, the mechanics, the merchants, and the body of the citizens protested against the
pro-slavery policy and proceedings in that territory. Of the large General Committee which the last of these meetings
appointed, and of which General Avvazzani, the distinguished Roman patriot and refugee, was chairman, Mr. Dawson was
chosen secretary. From that committee, and the State Convention which it called and controlled, and the National
Convention which was the outgrowth of it, proceeded that “Republican Party” which is now so well known in the history of
the Republic and of the world.
In 1855 he was an officer of the first Republican Convention held in Westchester County, where he then lived.
He wrote and reported the resolutions which were adopted by that convention, and widely copied by the press throughout
the State. By the same convention he was elected, with John Jay, Horace Greeley and William Bleaksley as his associates, to
represent Westchester County in the first Republican State Convention that was held in the State of New York. It will be
remembered that at that time, as at all times previously, the Democratic and the Whig parties maintained their respective
party organizations, presented their respective candidates for the popular support, and conducted their several campaigns
with all their old time partisan and selfish eagerness, without in the slightest degree affording any aid or comfort to the
young “Republican” party. It is now claimed by those who had opportunity to know, that some who appeared to sympathize

and to act with the new party, were really in full but secret communion with one or the other of the old parties, aiming at
nothing so much as to strengthen the old parties to which they had respectively belonged, by bringing to their support at the
polls as many votes as possible from the new organization. To a nature as frank and open as Mr. Dawson’s, everything like
mere cunning and artifice was intensely disagreeable, and the discovery in others of aims that were not simple and patriotic
like his own, tended to lessen his interest in the political struggles of the day.
Although he did not cease to insist that he was a “Democrat, and nothing else,” he continued to act with, and to
support the great “Republican Party” up to, and after the election of Mr. Lincoln in 1860 as President of the United States.
Later on he thought he discovered a tendency in the party toward the centralization of power in the General Government
that was in disregard of the Federal Constitution. Afterwards, when it became, in his view, still more conspicuous, he retired
from the field of politics altogether. At the time of his death he had not voted for many years.
After all, his tastes and his habits drew him irresistibly to his library and his writing table, where he found
congenial employment in study, especially in historical study, and in the use of his pen. He loved to investigate, and he
loved to write. As the qualities of his mind and the extent of his researches became more and more widely known, he was
more and more frequently called upon to communicate of his resources to the public. The veteran Clerk of the Common
Council of New York city, Deacon David T. Valentine, invited him to write a historical paper for the well known “Manual of
the Common Council of the City of New York,” of which he was the official editor. The result was a paper entitled “The
Park and its Vicinity,” occupying fifty-three pages of the Manual for 1855. It was Mr. Dawson’s first production in
American History. He presented such claims in behalf of New York, as against those of Boston, for priority in the
Revolutionary movements of the colonists, and he maintained them with authorities so unquestionable, drawn largely from
the contemporary newspapers of Boston and New York, that he at once arrested the attention of historical scholars
throughout the country, and the author of the paper, greatly to his own surprise, was honored with corresponding
membership in two leading historical societies, as well as with the congratulations of many of those of whose writings the
country is now justly proud. That paper was afterwards republished in several different forms.
His next effort was an elaborate paper, which occupied him more or less during two entire years, on “The
Military Retreats through Westchester County in 1776.” It was written for the New York Historical Society. Another paper,
quite as elaborate as the last, was entitled “The Life and Times of Ann Hutchinson.” It was prepared for the Baptist
Historical Society, and subsequently published in successive numbers of The New York Chronicle, a weekly Baptist paper
issued in New York city by the Rev. Pharcellus Church, D.D., and his two sons. Each of these papers may be said to have
broken up new ground in historical inquiry, and not only to have added to the author’s reputation as a painstaking and
faithful historian, but to have greatly enlarged the circle of his literary friends.
The most widely known, probably, of all Mr. Dawson’s writings was the large work entitled, “Battles of the
United States by Sea and Land.” It was written in successive parts in 1858, on the invitation of Johnson, Fry &amp; Co.,
publishers of a number of serials, and, when completed, was issued from the press in New York in two massive quarto
volumes beautifully printed, and elaborately illustrated with forty highly finished steel engravings. The work obtained a
circulation of thirty-five thousand copies, and gave its author a place in the front rank of writers on Military History in the
United States. The plan of the work is as peculiar as it is attractive and useful to the inquirer. The operations in each battle,
from that of Lexington to that before the city of Mexico, which ended in the surrender of that city, are given in detail,
fortified by copious references to the best authorities. To each of these separate narratives are appended all the principal
documents relating to that particular battle, and very frequently biographical sketches of the officers in command. While
engaged upon this laborious and trying work he was cheered by the encouraging approval and aid of President Sparks of
Harvard College, Williams Gilmore Sims, Washington Irving, Commodore Paulding, Captain Farragut, General Winfield
Scott, General John E. Wool, the family of General Worth, and others, the greater number of whom also furnished him with
unpublished material for his use in preparing his several narratives. The book took its place among the standard authorities
on the subject on which it treats.
An interesting correspondence grew out of the publication of “The Battles,” occasioned by some of the author’s
statements in regard to the conduct of General Putnam at the battles of Bunker Hill and of Long Island. Objections were
publicly raised by the Hon. Henry C. Deming and A. Clifford Griswold, Esq., well known residents of Hartford, Conn., in
the Hartford Daily Post, to which Mr. Dawson replied, and the correspondence extended over a period of six months, from
January 27 to July 29, 1859. Mr. Dawson is said to have obtained valuable information hitherto unpublished from the Hon.
George Bancroft, the great historian, in addition to what he had already discovered himself, and new light was thrown upon

several points of peculiar interest in our history. At the instance of a few private gentlemen in New York city, and to gratify
a demand for the correspondence which the paper could not supply, the articles on both sides were gathered up and
republished in 1860 under Mr. Dawson’s editorial care. As a result of the discussion the Legislature of Connecticut was led
to take special action on the subject involved.
It is impossible within the limits assigned to this article even to mention a large number of Mr. Dawson’s
contributions to our historical knowledge, and those that are referred to must necessarily be spoken on the briefest terms. In
May, 1859, on the invitation of the New York Historical Society, he prepared and read before that body a paper on the rise
and progress of the opposition in the Colony of New York to the Home Government. He devoted to it great care and labor.
At the expense of General J. Watts de Peyster, of Tivoli, New York, the paper was afterwards printed in an octavo volume
entitled, “The Sons of Liberty in New York: a Paper read before the New York Historical Society, May 3, 1859.” It is full of
interest and presents concisely the facts concerning the “Battle of Golden Hill,” in John Street, New York, in January, 1770,
where it is claimed the first blood of the Revolution was shed more than five years before the battle of Lexington. In 1860,
when the preservation of the Union was on the point of breaking out into open war, Mr. Dawson was already engaged on
two further contributions to our history, one entitled “The Life and Times of Daniel D. Tompkins, Governor of New York,
and Vice President of the United States,” and the other “The Military History of the United States.” The excitement of the
times, however, caused him to suspend his labors, and neither of them was ever finished.
Allusion has already been made to Mr. Dawson’s remarkable success in bringing to light important documents
and records that had long lain in obscurity or neglect. It may have been partly due to his good fortune, but behind all there
was a sagacity in him, which, by comparison of circumstances, and by inferences drawn from ascertained facts, made him
feel that the proofs of what he suspected to be true must somewhere exist. It was in this way that he brought out in
conspicuous view a fact that redounds to the lasting honor of Massachusetts. In the year 1862, while pursuing his
investigations into the political history of the American Revolution, the apparent silence of Massachusetts concerning
Independence in the early part of 1776 impressed him so strangely, that he was led to make a personal examination of the
archives of that State in the Secretary’s office at Boston. It resulted in the discovery of an Act of General Court, which up to
that time had been barely mentioned without comment by any historian, and altogether passed over in silence by nearly all
of them, in which that Colony had declared and practically established its own independence on May 1, 1776, two months
and three days before the Declaration of Independence by Congress, on July 4, 1776. That very important historical
information, illustrated with a facsimile of a commission from which the King’s name had been erased, and the King’s seal
destroyed, and a new authority given to the holder of it, not now by the King, as before, but by the Council of the Colony in
the name of “The Government and People of Massachusetts Bay in New England,” in accordance with the provisions of that
Act, was published by him in a letter addressed to the Hon. Luther Bradish, President of the New York Historical Society,
which was printed with the title, “New York Historical Society, Declaration of Independence of the Colony of
Massachusetts Bay, May 1, 1776.”
In the same way, while searching into the archives of the City of New York in 1862 for other information, he
found what afterwards led him to discover the entire series of Accounts between the City of New York and those who had
controlled its revenues while that city was occupied by the King’s troops and governed by martial law administered by the
Commander-in-Chief of the Royal army, from 1776 to 1783. As the originals of all these accounts had been carried away
when the Royal army evacuated the City in November, 1783, the finance department of the city had none of them, and at the
instance of the Hon. George Opdyke, then Mayor of the city, Mr. Dawson made a complete transcript of these accounts,
added copies of all certificates of those who had been appointed from time to time to audit them, illustrated the entire series
with elaborate notes embodying the several military orders on which the several collections and disbursements had been
made, and addressed the whole in a communication to the Mayor. He in turn transmitted it with a special message to the
Common Council, and that body ordered it to be printed entire in the Minutes of the Common Council. It was also printed
in a separate pamphlet at the expense of the city. Afterward, in addition to a handsome recompense in money, he received
from the Corporation of New York city its official thanks, of which an elegantly engrossed copy appropriately framed was
forwarded to him by the City Clerk. So far as the writer knows, it is the only instance where the official thanks of the great
City of New York has been voted for a purely historical service. The Council gave him also the unusual privilege of copying
and publishing any of its ancient records and files which he should, at any time, desire to employ. It need scarcely be said
that the recipient highly prized this recognition of his labors, and that he hung the engrossed copy of the city’s thanks in a

conspicuous place on the walls of his home, where it remained until the day of his death, and remains still as a family heirloom.
It was about this time that an application was made to Mr. Dawson by the venerable Joseph J. Lewis, of
Westchester, Penn., executor of the Wayne estate, personally a perfect stranger to Mr. Dawson, but induced by having read
“The Battles,” to write the Life of General Anthony Wayne, and the family papers were for that purpose accordingly placed
in his hands. The General’s descendants, however, having manifested but little or no interest in the undertaking, the work,
although commenced, was finally dropped. The incident led, nevertheless, to one good result. For when the fact had become
known that the Wayne papers had passed into Mr. Dawson’s hands, the executive committee of the New York State
Historical Society invited him to prepare and to read before that distinguished body a paper on the capture of Stony Point by
General Wayne, in July, 1779. He accepted the invitation, and in April, 1862, read before the Society the extended paper
which is one of his best productions, and has become known in Europe as well as in America. In order to save the time
required in copying the original manuscripts to be introduced into his paper, he adopted the novel expedient of taking those
identical manuscripts themselves to the reading desk, and there reading them, instead of the copies, to the large and
intelligent audience assembled to hear him. He had not thought of the effect that would be produced by reading, from those
old time-worn manuscripts of the Revolutionary period, as he had occasion to illustrate his subject, letters and papers in the
hand-writing of Washington, Lafayette, Wayne, and others but little less distinguished; but as he unfolded and read them,
one after the other, and went on with the absorbing recital, the great audience became intensely interested, and bent forward
to catch every word till he was done. It seemed as if the old heroes of the Revolution had come back to tell the story
themselves. At the close, the Hon. Luther Bradish, the President, declared to the anxious wife of the author, that no such
paper had been read before the Society in all the twenty years of his connection with it, and no such effect had been
produced. The paper was published in 1863 in a handsome volume appropriately dedicated “to the Hon. Joseph J. Lewis,
Commissioner of Internal Revenue of the United States, Washington, D.C.,” who had first applied to Mr. Dawson to write
the life of General Wayne. The volume included an appendix containing all the known historical material of that period
hearing on the subject, and was illustrated with facsimiles of all the principal manuscripts on which the paper was based, as
well as with a copy of the Military Map of the Assault on the Fort, which was published in 1784 by the geographer to the
King. The title of the volume is, “The Assault on Stony Point by General Anthony Wayne, July 16, 1779, prepared for the
New York Historical Society, ad read at its regular monthly meeting, April 1, 1862, with a Map, Facsimiles and Illustrative
Notes.”
Of his new and corrected edition of “The Federalist,” on which Mr. Dawson was engaged for a couple years, of
which, however, only one large volume was issued, as well as of the notable discussion growing out of it in the New York
Evening Post, between the Hon. John Jay and Colonel James A. Hamilton on one side, and himself on the other, afterward
published in an interesting pamphlet at the expense of several wealthy gentlemen for gratuitous distribution, our limits will
allow us no more than merely to speak in passing. It certainly throws light upon several debated questions. Other
publications successively issued must in like manner be omitted from our sketch for want of space.
In the spring of 1865 he accepted the position of editor of The Yonkers Gazette, which he held for about a year,
until he was obliged by illness to give it up. During that time, however, he made the first page of the paper the vehicle for
the publication of a vast amount of interesting and important matter on different phases of our Colonial and Revolutionary
history, which rendered the paper exceedingly valuable, so that files kept during that time commanded a remarkable price,
in one case fifty dollars having been offered for a complete set. Many of these publications, particularly the series on the
capture and execution of Major Andre, were afterward gathered up and issued in separate volumes.
In 1866 Mr. Dawson was drawn into the public discussion then going on concerning the Boundary Line between
the States of New York and New Jersey, and he made a valuable contribution to the published collection of papers, on one
side or the other, which that interesting debated called forth. The other writers, besides himself, were General John
Cochrane, Attorney General of the State of New York, and the Hon. J. Romeyn Brodhead, the historian of New York and
Secretary of the New York Historical Society, on one side, and the Hon. William A. Whitehead, historian of Perth Amboy
and Secretary of the New Jersey Historical Society, on the other. The Attorney General in his closing argument before the
United States Court paid a deserving tribute to Mr. Dawson for the service he had rendered in throwing light upon the points
at issue.
In the same year, 1866, Mr. Dawson bought The Historical Magazine, a well known Monthly devoted to
discussions upon the antiquities, history and biography of America. The publication had been commenced in Boston, in

January, 1857, under the able editorial management of Mr. John Ward Dean, but had been removed to New York in 1858.
There it was edited in succession by George Folsom, John Gilmary Shea and Dr. Henry B. Stiles. It had already gained for
itself a place in the periodical literature of the country, when the great Civil War broke out, which necessarily withdrew
from it support all its southern subscribers, including many of its valued contributors, the loss amounting altogether to more
than one half of its entire subscription list. Unfortunately, those whose names were still left on the books as subscribers,
were, many of them at least, such only in name. They were non-paying recipients of the work year after year, and appeared
to think that they were entitled to remain such. They had quite reversed the saying, “It is more blessed to give than to
receive.”
The first number of The Historical Magazine under Mr. Dawson’s editorial management was that of July, 1866.
In the following January, 1867, he commenced a “New Series” of the periodical, giving double the number of pages in each
monthly issue, and making two volumes per year, instead of a single volume as before. Into this work he three his entire
strength and intellectual energy during several years in succession, gathering around him also an array of distinguished
voluntary contributors to its pages, which had not been surpassed by the paid staff of any similar publication in the country.
The “Book Notices,” sometimes exceeding a hundred in a single month, for which the Magazine soon became famous, and
sought after by librarians and bibliophiles, were always written by Mr. Dawson himself. The effect of all this became soon
apparent in the more extended influence of the Magazine as one of the recognized historical authorities in the country. Its
material support, however, was largely drawn from the students of history in New England and New York; those in New
Jersey, Pennsylvania and the West seeming to take but little interest in sustaining it, and the South, where it had circulated
before the war, not having yet sufficiently recovered its strength to indulge in luxuries, the income was insufficient to meet
the expenses of publication, and so, after having issued what was equal to thirteen complete volumes, Mr. Dawson decided
to suspend its publication in April, 1876.
At the same time that he was editing and publishing The Historical Magazine, Mr. Dawson was engaged in
performing other historical services of value to the public. Some years before he had made a complete copy from the
Clinton Papers of the proceedings in the trial of the notorious Joshua Hett Smith before a General Court Martial at Tappan,
for the part which he ha taken in promoting the meeting at his house, back Haverstraw, of General Benedict Arnold and
Major John Andre, and in assisting the latter to effect his escape and return to New York. The record itself which he copied
was afterwards abstracted by some person unknown from among the Clinton Papers, and could not be found. Fortunately,
Mr. Dawson had previously taken his copy, and to supply the want occasioned by the loss, he conceived and carried out the
idea of editing and annotating hat copy of the trial, and having it published in a volume by itself. It was issued in excellent
style, and entitled, “Record of the Trial of Joshua Hett Smith, Esq., for alleged Complicity in the Treason of Benedict
Arnold, 1780. Edited by Henry B. Dawson: Morrisania, 1866.” He also edited and published, later on, five handsome
volumes under the title of “The Magazine Miscellany,” a selection of the more important historical papers that had been
published in The Historical Magazine.
Notwithstanding the natural delicacy of his constitution, and the incessant labors to which his keen intellectual
tastes and his indomitable energy impelled him, he enjoyed reasonably good health, with the exception of a severe attack of
pneumonia, until the summer of 1868, when, like several of his neighbors, he was prostrated with malaria, produced by the
opening of new streets in the vicinity of his home in Morrisania. The ague and fever came as an unwelcome visit every
second day during all the summer and autumn months, confining him to his house and obliging him in his enfeebled
condition to work at a great disadvantage in editing and publishing The Historical Magazine. In 1869 he had a return of the
same trouble, and yet, singular as it may seem, it did not prevent him from writing and publishing, one after another, a
succession of valuable contributions to our history. One was entitled, “The First Blood shed in the American Revolution: the
Battle of Golden Hill,” a closely printed paper of twenty-one pages in small quarto, in which, as his paper entitled, “The
Sons of Liberty,” before mentioned, it was shown, so far as the known facts afford a basis of judgment, that the first
collision of the Royal forces with the Colonists where resistance was made and blood shed, was in John Street, New York,
between Gold Street and Pearl, on January 19 and 20, 1770.
Mr. Dawson’s ill health, however, was becoming gradually more and more pronounced, and his literary activity
and productiveness correspondingly diminished, so that from 1876 until 1884 he may be said, in a sense, to have been
withdrawn from the world, confined to his house, and apparently a permanent invalid. Yet even then, in those long days of
bodily weakness, he wrote a searching review of the second edition of Bolton’s “History of Westchester County,” which he
published in numbers in the The Westchester Times, and several articles on the “Early History of American Methodism,”

published in The Christian Advocate in New York City. In 1884 he was again pressed into the service by J. Thomas Scharf,
A.M., LL.D, as one of the writers of the New History of Westchester County, which that gentleman had projected, and
which was finally published in Philadelphia, in 1886. Mr. Dawson entered into the undertaking with characteristic zest and
vigor, and he furnished a most valuable contribution to the work covered two hundred and eighty-one large and closely
printed pages on “Westchester County, New York, during the American Revolution.” Although the limits of the history did
not allow him to bring down the narrative to a later date than November, 1776, he lays bare, in a striking manner, the hidden
political springs behind many of the outward movements, and adds largely to our knowledge of those times. It is said to be
the most ably written of all his historical works, and it was fitting it should so, as his last bequest to our country’s history.
Like nearly all men who have pursued his line of effort, he investigated and wrote upon many subjects, often
extended and valuable papers, that have never been given to the world. Putting them all together, the published and the
unpublished, they present an immense and almost bewildering mass of literary and historical matter, requiring an amount of
labor, at the very thought of which any ordinary human being would stand appalled.
He received from many quarters the most gratifying tokens of the appreciation and regard in which he was held
for his services in the promotion of our historical knowledge. One of these was so peculiar, that it ought not to go
unmentioned. It was a complete list of the Governors of Pennsylvania from he settlement of the colony down to the year
1870, including their pictures from William Penn to John W. Geary, with a mass of political and historical statistics, all
compiled and handsomely arranged in a bound manuscript volume by William H. Egle, M.D., connected as State Librarian
with the Government of Pennsylvania, at Harrisburg. It bears this dedication in black and red ink: “To Mr. Henry B.
Dawson, Morrisania, N.Y., This MS. Compliation is Respectfully Inscribed.” Although a stranger to Mr. Dawson, Dr. Egle
accompanied his gift with a letter written on a blank leaf at the beginning of the volume, of which the following is a copy:

“Harrisburg, Penn’s.
September 17, 1869
To Henry B. Dawson, Esq.
My very dear Sir:
My veneration for what is true and valuable in History has prompted me in compiling this unique affair. I offer
it to you as a poor tribute of my admiration for you as a faithful historian, of my respect for you as a man of letters, and my
sincere esteem for your personal worth.
William H. Egle”
As the writer has reason to know, it was a spontaneous tribute that touch Mr. Dawson deeply. His services were
recognized also by more public resolution of thanks tendered to him by many organized bodies, and he was elected to
honorary membership in a long list of historical societies from Massachusetts to Minnesota. In May, 1889, the Board of
Trustees of Syracuse University resolved to confer upon him the honorary distinction of Doctor of Laws, to be publicly
announced at its commencement in the following June. It was an honor that came too late. He died, as already states, on the
23d of May. It is said of Copernicus, that as he lay on his death bed, only a few hours before he breathed his last, the great
work of his life, De Orbium Celestium Revolutionibus, which had just come from the press at Nuremberg, was brought to
him that he might see it, before his eyes should close forever upon the light of time. He touched the book with his but half
conscious hand, as if he knew what it was, and then in the next moment sank into insensibility and passed away, only a day
later in the same month, on may 24, 1543. Happier than he, Mr. Dawson saw the tangible fruits of his labor as they came
from the press while he was yet living, but he never knew of the academic laurel that was about to be laid upon his brow.
How the brightness of all human glory grows dim, when the eye fails, and the heart sinks to rest, in life’s closing hour!

“Can storied urn, or animated bust,
Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?
Can Honor’s voice provoke the silent dust,
Or Flattery soothe the dull cold ear of death?”

Mr. Dawson was married on May 28, 1845, to Catharine, daughter of Abraham D. Martling and Esther
Whelpley, his wife, of Tarrytown, Westchester County, New York. She belonged to one of the oldest families in the county,
whose lineage ran back to the first settlers along the lower Hudson, and thence to an ancient Holland ancestry, of which she
had good reason to be proud. In 1885 the husband wife commemorated the fortieth anniversary of their wedding, and the
writer of these lines was permitted to offer his congratulations in these two brief stanzas, that had at least the one merit of
coming from the heart.

“Thank God for forty years of wedded life,
Of love and peace and sweet domestic cheer,
While the glad eyes of husband and of wife
Still see each other’s face so long held dear.
I waft my greeting from the Hudson’s shore,
To where the Harlem’s tides roll up and down,
And pray that Heaven may bless you more and more,
And all the coming years with goodness crown.”

Mr. Dawson was a frank, ingenuous man, loving the truth, full of benevolent feeling, and taking pleasure in
being helpful to others whenever it lay in his power. His vast stores of historical information and his vast library were
readily placed at the service of every sincere inquirer who applied to him, and few have more reason for gratitude than the
writer of this sketch of his life. He has been criticized, and it may be with a measure of apparent justice, for a certain rigor
of speech, which the French call tranchant, in the exciting controversies into which he was drawn, and it must be confessed
that in the maintenance of his honest convictions he did sometimes strike hard, but, after all, his heart was full of generous
kindness to others, and it came out in manifold ways in the intercourse of daily life. In his religious faith he was a Calvinist
of the old school, simple as a child in love and trust, and while resolute and heroic in the public defence of what he believed
to be true on any subject, yet as gentle as a woman in his relations with his family and friends. The atmosphere of his home
was delightful, and there, more than anywhere else on earth, his memory will be cherished by surviving wife and children as
a sacred inheritance and trust. As he said himself, after his public labors had finally closed, he spent the time in his home,
setting his home in order “preparatory to receiving the summons of his Heavenly Father,” and entering into rest.
His funeral took place from his late residence in Home Street, Morrisania, New York city, on May 26, 1889, and
was attended by many men eminent in journalism and letters, who testified their respect and sorrow. In conformity with his
own request, expressed while living, the services were conducted by his friend the writer of this simple tribute, who
delivered an address giving an estimate of Mr. Dawson’s character, life and worth. On the following day, May 27th, all that
was mortal was committed to the grave in the burying ground of the Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow at Tarrytown, and
almost in the shadow of the Old Church itself. There may they rest in peace, and awake at last in the resurrection of the just!
