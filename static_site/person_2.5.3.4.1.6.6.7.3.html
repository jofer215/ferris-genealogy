            <div class="person-text">(2.5.3.4.1.6.6.7.3) RUSSEL CLARKSON HAND (Lieutenant Colonel) born March 1, 1874 Yankton
SD; from The New York Times, July 30, 1918: Lieutenant Colonel Russell C. Hand, U.S.A., whose
home was in Sioux City, iowa and whose death from wounds received in action in France was
announced yesterday’s list from General Pershing, was a Captain in the 18th U.S. Infantry when
Congress declared war. He enlisted in the 2d Cavalry in 1898 as a Private and was commissioned a 2d
Lieutenant of the 10th Infantry in July 1900. His old regiment, the 18th, is now one of the four infantry
units of the 1st Division of regulars under Major General Bullard, and it is probable that he was a
battalion commander of that unit when he received the wound that caused his death. LtCol Hand was
44 years of age and was born in South Dakota. He served in the Spanish War, in the Philippines, and
was at Vera Cruz.</div>
