            <div class="person-text">(1.1.3.12.1.1) FERRIS JACOBS, JR., (Photo) born March 20, 1836 Delhi NY and died
there August 30, 1886; buried Woodlawn Cemetery (headstone photos). After
completing his early schooling at Delaware Academy (Delaware Literary Institute), he
entered Williams College, Williamstown, Miss., and upon graduation in 1856 (in the
same class as President Garfield) he pursued the study of law in Philadelphia, but after
changed to Delhi, where he was connected with the office of Parker and Gleason; and
was admitted to the bar in 1859. When the Civil War broke out, he gathered about 100
men of Delaware County and formed Company E of the 3d Regiment Cavalry
(commanded by J.H. Van Alen) with himself as their Captain; mustered August 22, 1861
at Elmira for 3 years service. After two years of active fighting he was promoted to
Major, and a year and many bloody battles later, to Lieutenant Colonel and commanded
his regiment. His regiment was so cut up and reduced in numbers that it was necessary
to consolidate it with other regiments and he resigned. (In 1864, he was mustered out of
service and returned home), but in 1865, he reentered the service, assigned to duty on
the northern frontier, and participated in several campaigns until being mustered out and
brevetted Brigadier General. Resuming his law practice, he was twice elected District

Attorney (1865 and 1871); defeated for office of County Judge; and in 1881, was elected
to the U.S. Congress (1881-83). He married November 10, 1869 at Yellow Springs OH,
Mary Eleanor Hyde [dau of Robert &amp; Allison Hume (Kedsie) Hyde] born September 10,
1842 Yellow Springs OH (Delhi NY) and died August 2, 1895, presumably at Delhi; and
