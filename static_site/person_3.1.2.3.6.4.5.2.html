Mrs. Cora F. Morse, one of the best known of the sanitarium nurses, died last evening at 6 o&#x27;clock at the
sanitarium hospital, after 6 weeks of great suffering. Death resulted indirectly from influenza, this
being followed by a complication of diseases. Mrs. Morse came to the sanitarium first when a girl of
18. Had she lived until July she would have been 50 years old. The greater part of her life has been
spent at the Sanitarium. Coming to the institution in the year, 1888, she was married 2 years later, then
going with her husband to Muskoka, Canada, to reside on a farm. A few years later her husband was
drowned in Muskoka Lake, leaving the wife with 3 small children. In 1905, Mrs. Morse returned to the
Sanitarium and took the nurse&#x27;s course and has been connected ever since with the institution. She has
