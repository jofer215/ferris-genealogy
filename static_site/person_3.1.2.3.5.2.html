(3.1.2.3.5.2.1) DAVID C FERRIS (Photo) born 1832 Plattsburg NY; moved with his parents, and a
brother and sister, to Whitehall NY 1839; he was sent to a seminary at Granville, Washington, NY
where he remained for 3y; thence he went on board the steamer Francis Saltus (the first opposition
boat ever constructed on Lake Champlain) in the capacity of clerk, which position he held until 1849;
then he secured the place of Chief Clerk in the Iron Works of Rosslow &amp; Gould in Essex, Essex, NY
where he remained until the spring of 1850, when he left on the Crescent City for Aspinwall, bound for
California, arriving in San Francisco in July, he went at once to Sacramento, then the great mining
center, took stage passage in Jim Burch’s stage line for Coloma and Sutter’s Mill, the place where gold
was first discovered, and went to mining with a rocker, shaking out from $8 and upways a day. In the
spring of 1851 he returned to Sacramento and remained there until 1852 in business, when he removed
to San Francisco and engaged in the wholesale clothing line. In 1858 he started out for the Russian
possessions on Frazer River and engaged in placer mining, remaining a comparatively short time and
being among the few to return to San Francisco with a large amount of gold dust. This amount was
subsequently expended in a heavy lawsuit, settling the Sutter title to Sacramento, which litigation was
conducted by Milton S Latham and Thomas Sunderland and is recorded as the suit of Ferris vs Cover.
Silver being discovered in Washoe, State of Nevada in 1859, Mr Ferris embarked in the development of
the mines of the great Comstock lode (being the first to recommend the diamond drill, which
discovered the great bonanza, and was owned and controlled by Colonel A. J. Severance, and by him
perfected) and being very successful continued various mining operations in Arizona, Utah, Colorado
and California. He introducted the giant powder in San Francisco and was the originator of the Safe
Deposit block, the finest edifice in California. In 1864, he married Letitia Metcalf (in San Francisco),
the daughter of Captain Ernest Metcalf, of the English Army. Mr. Ferris resided in Oakland with his
mother; was one of the stockholders in the Silver Cliff Mining Co of Colorado.</div>
