            <div class="person-text">(3.1.2.1) SAMUEL FERRIS JR., born December 10, 1720 Greenwich CT and died Kingston NY;
married August 22, 1743 in Stamford, Mary Purdy (Pardee) (2.1.5.1) and born to them were:

(3.1.2.1.1) JEHIEL FERRIS born September 13, 1744 (September 24, 1777 Delaware Co NY) and
died June 28, 1833 at age 88y 9m 5d; buried at Hilton Cemetery, Troy, Bradford, PA (Photo);
shoemaker who lived in Delaware Co NY and moved west to West Burlington PA 1793, buying land
afterwards; there is a Jehiel Ferris, Cartman, listed as a Freeman, April 1, 1784 by the New York
Historical Society; after the loss of his first wife, he apparently placed his children in homes of friends
[or sister] and moved to PA; 1799 he returned to NY to marry his second wife and returned to
Burlington with her and her two sons, Timothy, Jr., and Jessee; married 1st December 30, 1769 at
Woodstock/Kingston NY (Old Dutch Church) Margaret (Sanford) Boing (widow of Charles Boing)
who died 1791 Duanesburgh NY (both Jehiel &amp; Margaret resided in Woodstock, Ulster County, when
they married); 2d 1799 widow Abigail (Bennett)Beach (Mrs. Timothy Beach) [dau of James] born May
14, 1748 and died May 22, 1813 age 65y 8d; buried at The Hilton Cemetery; and 3d April 21, 1814 in
Burlington PA, (also her 3d marriage) Elizabeth (Ellsworth) (Blakesley) (Prouty) born April 8, 1772
W. Springfield MA and died December 13, 1850 age 78y 7m 20d - she is listed as a daughter of Jehiel
(error) in the record of The Hilton Cemetery; it is said that Jehiel courted Elizabeth all of 15 minutes he was 75 and she was 42! [Jim -that explains the short courtship!] When Jehiel married Abigail, they
moved to West Burlington PA and Margaret moved back with her father. Part of the Beach/Ferris farm
was given to the town to enlarge the local cemetery, The Hilton. Their farmhouse stood for many years
next to The Hilton. Jehiel, Elizabeth, Abigail and others are burned at The Hilton. Born to Jehiel and
presumably Margaret were (and possibly others) (probably not in birth sequence):</div>
