Stinson, Morrison, and Hecker; Since joining the firm in 1981, Doug has handled a wide variety of litigation as well as
arbitration and administrative proceedings. A significant portion of his practice has been devoted to environmental litigation.
He has represented clients in large Superfund enforcement actions and in numerous CERCLA cost recovery suits. These
matters have included representation of the City of Wichita in a large CERCLA cost recovery action against several dozen
PRPs who contaminated over 3800 acres of commercial and residential properties near downtown. He has also represented
clients in actions involving the enforcement of private indemnity agreements between potentially responsible parties at
Superfund sites and in environmental insurance coverage cases. Among these environmental insurance coverage cases is a
suit on behalf of the City of Overland Park, Kansas against multiple carriers who had issued policies to the City from the
early 1960s to the late 1980s. He has handled actions concerning petroleum pipeline spills, bioremediation of petroleum
wastes, wastewater discharge permit violations, waterways cleanups, and coal gasification wastes. Doug has also served as
an arbitrator for the N.A.S.D. and has represented both customers and brokerage firms in arbitration matters before the
N.A.S.D., the N.Y.S.E. and the American Arbitration Association.
