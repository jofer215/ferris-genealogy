            <div class="person-text">(3.5.5.6) SYLVANUS MEAD (8RK2-3D) (Captain) born January 19, 1739 Greenwich and died 1780
Mianus CT; served in the French and Indian War as a Corporal in Captain Thomas Hobby’s Company,
3d Connecticut Regiment in the campaign of 1759 against Crown Point and Fort Ticonderoga. At the
commencement of the Revolutionary War, he received a commission as ensign in Captain Ebenezer
Hill’s Company, 7th Connecticut Regiment, Continental Line and was at the siege of Boston and
promoted to First Lieutenant in Captain Samuel Keeler’s Company, May, 1776. Sylvanus was stationed
during the greater part of the summer and early fall of 1776 at Bergen Heights (now Jersey City), and
in October of that year was ordered up the river to the vicinity of Fort Lee. In November, most of the
regiment, including Lieutenant Mead’s Company was sent across the river to assist in the defence of
Fort Washington, which on the sixteenth day of November 1776, was captured with its entire garrison
among whom was Sylvanus. He was afterwards exchanged and promoted to Captain of a company of
rangers raised by order of the General Assembly at the May Session, 1777. On the fourth day of August
1777, by order of the Governor and the Council, the company of rangers raised in the Town of
Greenwich, commanded by Captain Sylvanus Mead, both officers and men, were discharged and
returned to the companies to which they belonged. At the annual town meeting held on the fourteenth
day of December 1778, Captain Sylvanus Mead was chosen one of the Committee of Safety and also
Barrackmaster. Sylvanus was constantly hounded by the ‘cowboys’ and they finally, during the early
part of 1780, traced him to the old Ralph Peck place at Mianus and one of them knocked at the door.
He called out from within “who’s there?” when one of them answered by firing through the door. The
ball struck Sylvanus, wounding him fatally, and he died the following day. He married June 2, 1763
