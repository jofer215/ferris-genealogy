            <div class="person-text">(2.1.3.3.1.1.2.5.1.1.4) MARGARET KNOWLTON BELKNAP born October 19, 1897 Cook Co IL and
died August 1983 Berea KY; married John Milton Allen [son of William Ervin &amp; Catherine Alice
(Benner) Allen] born July 23, 1896 Byron Township, Kent MI and died November 1937.
Margaret Belknap Allen, in her early years, moved into the world of music in a natural creative way. Previous to any
professional training, at the age of five, she was improvising on the piano, intuitively expressing four part harmony, and
rounding out the tonal meanderings with a certain amount of phrase form. Fortunately her first teacher, the then noted Mrs.
Crosby Adams of Chicago, was a pioneer in the imaginative and creative approach to music training. This, of course,
nurtured the child’s inherent urge, so that soon after her lessons began she startled her father (sitting next to her in church)
by singing the harmonic structure of the hymns rather than the words. “Quiet now” he would whisper. Later, at the age of
ten, she organized a club in Oak Park, where she lived, teaching her interested peers to improvise. Oberlin College and the
University of Wisconsin left their strengthening stamp upon her: but she was always haunted by the wonderment of “why
music moved as it did?” “what was the inner necessity that made the rules of music effective?” The casual answers never
seemed to satisfy her. While she was teaching Interpretive Dance and Drama in Evanston, she met Martha Russell and
became acquainted with the Creative Motion principle with its necessity of involving the whole self in order to experience
the needs of the music. At last dance, drama, rhythm, melody and harmony all moved together in a wholeness of
expression. After marrying John Milton Allen they moved to Scarsdale, New York. Here she taught in her private studio for
sixteen years, inspiring the students to hear inside that which the music actually wanted them to hear on the outside. The
response and the results justified the approach. Following the death of her husband, and after her daughter and son had left
home for their further education, she chose to transplant herself to a college campus where the student’s background was
different from those of Westchester, Berea College invited her to teach in the Music Department where she has taught for
twenty five years, interrupted only in order to get her Master’s degree at Stanford University. She eventually became
professor of Humanities and Piano, but it was always the Creative Motion principle that guided her teaching. As a little
Scarsdale boy once said to her: “I hope you never die” she realized that those who truly experience Creative Motion gain
something “which makes all of the difference” not only to their music, but to their selfhood. Margaret donated a

Holtkamp Organ to the Berea College’s music department. Born to them were:</div>
