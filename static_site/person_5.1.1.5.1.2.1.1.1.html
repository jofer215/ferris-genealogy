Co MO; for two years was a student in the high school at Chillicothe, and four years 1878-82, was at
the University of Missouri, where he took his degree from the law department; engaged during
vacations at farm work and clerking in a country store. After graduating from law school he taught one
term of school at Wheeling, and was in the Moberly High School during 1883-84, and principal of a
ward school there for one year; May 1885 he began the practice of law at Moberly. In building up a law
practice at Moberly, Mr. Ferris did not neglect the demands of citizenship. He served as state
committeeman and country chairman of the Republican party, was a delegate to the National
Convention in 1904, a member of the Moberly Board of Education from 1896 to 1902, being president
of the board four years of that time. In 1898 he was president of the Missouri School Board
Association, and from 1899 to 1903 was a member of the Moberly Public Library Board, during which
time the Carnegie Library was built. In October 1907, Mr. Ferris was employed by Attorney-General
Herbert S. Hadley as assistant attorney general in the prosecution of the Insurance Trust, Lumber Trust
and Harvester Trust, and his work contributed to the great fame achieved by Mr. Hadley in those cases
of national importance. He was associated with Mr. Hadley in these cases until January 1909. At that
time he removed to Saint Louis, from Moberly, and from January 1909 to January 1913, served as
assistant circuit attorney of Saint Louis. On January 1, 1913, he formed a partnership with Henry A.
Rosskopf in the frim of Ferris &amp; Rosskopf. After his partner was appointed to the bench in February,
1925, Mr. Ferris practiced along until January 1, 1927, when he became associated with former
Congressman Cleveland A. Newton and Marion C. Early, with offices in the Wainwright Building.
January 1, 1929, Mr. Ferris, a republican, became first assistant circuit attorney, serving by appointment
under Franklin Miller, a Democrat, who was elected circuit attorney of the City of Saint Louis by an
exceptionally large vote on a reform issue. Mr. Ferris for many years has been a lecturer at the Benton

College of Law, and members of the profession outside of Saint Louis know him as joint author of
Ferris and Rosskopf’s Instructions to Juries, Civil and Criminal, for Missouri and Arkansas, and as
author with his son of Ferris on Extraordinary Legal Remedies. He was author of Moberly
Libraries and Literary Societies, published in 1904. Mr. Ferris was a member of the Society of Saint
Louis Authors, a member of the Zoological Society of Saint Louis, and the State Historical Society of
