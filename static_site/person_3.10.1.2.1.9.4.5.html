            <div class="person-text">(3.10.1.2.1.9.4.5) THOMAS DEWIGHT DARBY born November 23, 1842 Cortland NY and died
August 30, 1900 Clarksville, Butler, Iowa; married March 21, 1865 in Cortlandville, Frances Elizabeth
Bement [dau of Julius &amp; Sarah (Darling)] born April 5, 1845 Skaneatelas, Onondaga, NY and died
February 06, 1920 4 3/4 mile NW of Clarksville, Butler, Iowa; both buried Lynwood Cemetery,
Clarksville, Butler IA.
Just 1 year before Thomas Dewight Darby born, John Tyler became the 10th president, &amp; Horace
Greeley established the New York Tribune. Those famous Horace Greeley words, &quot;Go West, Young
Man, Go West&quot;, would undoubtedly be an influence in Thomas&#x27;s life. Family History has written:
&quot;Thomas was of average height; slender build, had hazel eyes, and always wore a full beard. He was a
Schoolmaster for a time in New York, as well as a farmer, &amp; farmed in Iowa.&quot; In 1868, just a year
before Ulysses Grant was elected president, the first transcontinental railroad in the United States was
completed, &amp; the National Woman Suffrage Association was formed, Thomas &amp; Frances his wife,
&quot;Came out to Iowa with his wife &amp; baby, when baby Lucius was only 8 months old. They stopped for a
short time at Wisconsin on their way from New York, then moved out to the farm in Clarksville, Iowa
now owned by his Grandson, Mervin. Thomas was very well liked and friendly. He had asthma, and
always had a cough for years. Doctors had told him to smoke a pipe for relief! He was not well for
years before his death, and was kicked in the lungs by a horse, &quot;Old Jack&quot; before his death - died of a
lung hemorrhage&quot;. The Clarksville Star, Sept 6, 1900: &quot;Thomas D. Darby born in Dryden, Tompkins
County, NY, Nov 23, 1842, and died at his home in Jackson Township, Butler County, Iowa, August 30,
1900. On March 21, 1865 he married Miss Frances E. Bement and to them born one son, Lucius E.
Darby. The wife and the son both survive. In 1868 Mr. Darby and his family came to Clarksville and
shortly afterwards they took up their home on the farm in Jackson township where he passed away.
Funeral services were conducted from the home Friday afternoon. Rev. Van Loon delivering the
discourse in the presence of a large gathering of friends and neighbors. The deceased was a man of
uprightness and quietude - loved by his family and respected by his neighbors. He was a selfsacrificing and Christian man and his memory will long be cherished by those who knew him. His
health had been poor for many months and death came as a result of hemorrhage of the lungs.&quot; (Had
been kicked by a horse - &quot;Old Jack&quot; prior to his death, and apparently had internal injuries.)
The Darby Family History has recorded that Grandma Frances Bement was 5&#x27;6&quot; tall, (tall for a women
in that era), and weighed about 160 pounds. She had brown hair, which began graying in her early 30&#x27;s.
She was referred to as a beautiful woman. She called herself &quot;Frank&quot; in younger years as shown by the
marriage license in Cortlandville, in 1865 &amp; land records in Dryden, New York. Frances was a
descendant of Samuel &quot;The Puritan&quot; Chapin through her Grandmother Betsey Hitchcock married to
John Bement. Betsey is a descendant of Luke Hitchcock, who is a descendant of Samuel Chapin.
Frances is related to the signer of the Declaration of Independence through her mother Sarah
Emmaline Darling, &amp; through her mother&#x27;s mother Frances Hart, daughter of Timothy &amp; Sarah (second
cousins) Hart. We have a copy of Timothy &amp; Sarah&#x27;s marriage license from Hopewell, Hunterdon, New
Jersey, &amp; Timothy&#x27;s gravestone in the McLean Baptist Cemetery notes proudly &quot;Born in New Jersey.&quot;
Timothy &amp; Sarah&#x27;s mutual ancestor, John Hart married to Mary Hunt is the father of Joseph Hart

(Joseph II, Timothy) &amp; he is the father of John Hart, (Richard, Sarah), &amp; he is the father of Captain
Edward Hart, father of John Hart who signed the Declaration of Independence. That would mean both
Sarah &amp; Timothy&#x27;s Fathers (Joseph II &amp; Richard) are cousins to John Hart the signer of the Declaration,
making Frances a cousin, 4 times removed of the signer, John Hart. (Sarah &amp; Timothy are once
removed, Frances Hart is #2, Sarah Darling is #3, &amp; Frances Elizabeth Bement is 4 times removed
from the cousin relationship between our Hart families &amp; the signer’s families.)Born to them was:</div>
