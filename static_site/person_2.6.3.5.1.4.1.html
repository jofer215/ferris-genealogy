            <div class="person-text">(2.6.3.5.1.4.1) GEORGE W. QUINTARD (Photo) born April 22, 1822 Stamford and died April 2, 1913
NYC; went, still young, into New York City, where he was engaged a few years in the grocery
business; married February 15, 1844 Frances Elizabeth Morgan [dau of Charles &amp; Emily (Reeves)
Morgan] and they had two children. Disposing of his grocery business he entered the firm of his
father-in-law, then T.F. Secor &amp; Co., Mr. Secor being the foundry-man of the firm and Mr. Morgan the
financier. Afterwards, under the title of the Morgan Iron Works, in company with his father-in-law, and
later with his brother-in-law, the Hon. F.M. Merrit, of Stamford, and still later as the sole proprietor of
those extensive works, Mr. Quintard laid the foundation of the great business prosperity which place
him among the leading men of the city. USS Onondaga (Photo), a double-turreted monitor, built by
Quintard’s company, served the Union 1864-65 and then sold to France for service in the French Navy
