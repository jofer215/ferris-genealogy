and hereby appoint my said son William Barton, sole executor of my last will and testament and it is
my desire and request that in case he acts as such executor, no bond shall be required to file by him in
probate court. In witness where I have hereunto set my hand seat the ___ day of June in the year of our
Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty eight. John Barton. Born to them were:</div>
