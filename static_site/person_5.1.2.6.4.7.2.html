            <div class="person-text">(5.1.2.6.4.7.2) ELLEN AUGUSTA FERRIS (Photo) born 1847 (as per tombstone) Ashland NY and
died 1913 Walton, Delaware, NY; married 1866 in Ashland, Tallman Charles Bookout (Bookhout) [son
of William &amp; Lucy Caroline (Hull) Bookhout] (Bookhout as per tombstone) born November 24, 1841
in Roxbury, Delaware, NY and died 1909 Delaware Co NY; buried Walton Cemetery (Photos).
Tallman was a Civil War Vet – discharged July 8, 1864 – member of GAR Post 209. He for many years
was identified with the agricultural element of Walton NY and in the pursuit of his chosen occupation
amassed a competence. He was a man of great energy, enterprise and financial ability and occupied an
important position among the successful and influential businessmen of Walton. He had a liberal
education. At the first call for troops he enlisted in defense of his country in Company I, 72nd NY
Volunteer Infantry, being the first volunteer from his town. With his regiment he served in Sicles&#x27;s
Brigade, and was active and courageous participant in many of the most important and decisive
engagements of the Rebellion among the earlier ones being the siege of Yorktown, Battles of
Williamsburg, Fair Oaks, Seven Pines, and the Peninsular Campaign. He was stricken with fever and
sent to the David Island Hospital NY where he remained 5 months. Here joined his regiment at Brandy
Station VA and was attached to General Hancock&#x27;s corps at the battle of the Wilderness, but during the
2nd days fight was wounded and left for dead on the field of battle, which, says Draper, &quot;was
throbbing with the wound&quot;. He was wounded in the left shoulder and left eye, the ball striking his gun
and being shattered, 3 pieces entering his body. He was a courageous soldier and expert marksman and
in relating the history of army life often says that, if every Union man had killed as many of his

adversaries as he did there would not have been a rebel left to tell his side of the conflict. Among his
victims was the rebel who killed the major of his regiment, he shot him 6 times before killing him and
being shot at the same number of times by his opponent. He was subsequently sent to the hospital at
Fredericksburg, narrowly escaping capture on the way thither. This was within 15 days of the time for
the expiration of his term of enlistment, and he was offered a furlough, he proceeded as far as
Washington on his way home, but his patriotic impulses were in the ascendant, and he returned to
Fredericksburg, starting on foot with hope in striking a train. Arriving at Fredericksburg, he found
himself in the rear of Grants Army and followed with his own regiment, which he joined in Cold
Harbor. He went into the midst of the fray at that place with his arm in a sling and without fire-arms,
but soon procured the latter from the body of a dead comrade. He did heroic duty with his uninjured
arm, probably firing as many effective shots as others with the use of both. He next went with his
company to Ream&#x27;s Station at Bermuda Hundred and was subsequently at the siege of Petersburg, this
being after his term of service had expired. He was also in the engagement at Weldon Railroad,
afterward retiring from active duty, and returned home July 8th 1864. His wound was very painful and
gave him much trouble, not healing for more than a year and costing him about $150.00. In 1893, he
retired his farm labors and removed into the Village of Walton, where he enjoyed the pleasant leisure to
which his previous years of toil entitled him. In politics he was a firm adherent of the Republican party
and although not a politician was deeply interested in local and national matters. He belonged to Ben
Marvin Post #209, Grand Army of the Republic and was prominent in the Masonic Circles. Born to
