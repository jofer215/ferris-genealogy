            <div class="person-text">(1.4.8.4.2) HANNAH LAWRENCE born September 21, 1767 and died 1811 in New
Orleans of Yellow Fever; buried Protestant Cemetery on Girod Street, New Orleans LA;
married 1st Jonathan Drake [son of Moses] born c1770 Eastchester NY and died
September 1797 NYC; buried Joseph Rodman Drake Park, Hunts Point, Bronx NY;
From Terri MacDonald – Jonathan had a store at 60 Water Street, 1790; 1791 store
became dry goods store; 1792-93 listed as merchantafter Hannah’s husband lost his
wealth in the celebrated Yazoo land speculation in 1795 and died two years later in a
yellow fever epidemic, she met the situation courageously, and sought to provide for her
young family by opening a boarding house at 275 Pearl Street. The city directories from
1797-1808 show the name of “Mrs. Hannah Drake”, first at 275 Pearl Street, then at 54
Cliff Street, then at 201 Pearl Street, and finally at 96 Maiden Lane, where she remained
for four years; but mention of the boarding house occurs only in the 1797 directory, so
we don’t know how long she found it necessary to maintain it as a source of income. On
March 25, 1809 in NYC, she married Robert Muir Welman, previously twice married
and twice widowed. Shortly after their 18090 marriage, Robert, a merchant, became a
member of the firm of Welman &amp; Phillips of New Orleans, and he moved his three
daughters by previous marriages, along with his new wife and her two newly acquired
stepdaughters to New Orleans. Robert’s firm provided many of the Louisiana plantations
with supplies; he was a native of Bermuda, and is reputed to have brought the first
oleanders and crepe-myrtles to Louisiana from Bermuda. Born to Hannah and Jonathan
