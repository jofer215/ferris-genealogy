            <div class="person-text">(4.4.5.1.3.4) RALPH INGERSOLL LOCKWOOD (#1544) born July 8, 1798 Stanwich CT and died
unmarried April 12, 1858 NY; lawyer; attracted the attention of the New York Bar by his wit and
eloquence. For many years he was one of the leading chancery lawyers of the State, attacking the
decisions of the Court of Chancery with a vigor and fearlessness quite startling to the conservative
mind of those days. He was the author and annotator of several law books and of numerous pamphlets;
among the former may be mentioned, Bright’s Husband and Wife, and Lockwood’s Reversed Cases. In
addition to his solid learning, Ralph enjoyed a great reputation as a wit and raconteur. He gave much
time and thought to general literature, and was the author of two novels, Rosine Laval and The
Insurgents, the latter being dedicated to Chateaubriand, and drawing from him a very complimentary
letter. The dedication to the great French author is accounted for from the fact that Ralph was a fine
French scholar, visit France on two different occasions, and by his knowledge of the language was able
to act as counsel for the leading French citizens of New York. He was one of the founders of the New
York Law Library and of the American Institute; intimate friend of Henry Clay</div>
