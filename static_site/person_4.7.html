            <div class="person-text">(4.7) SARAH LOCKWOOD (#16) born 1678; married June 19, 1707 Stamford CT, by Captain
Nathaniel Selleck, Justice of the Peace, (Micall) Michael Lounsbury [son of Richard &amp; Elizabeth
(Pennoyer)] born 1680 Rye NY and died January 20, 1730/31. He bought land 1702 on Pepper Ridge,

near Taunton. Michael’s father, Richard, was an early settler and one of the proprietors of Peningo
Neck (Rye NY) - he sold his land and rights in 1673-82, but retained land on Budd’s Neck, which was
left, in his will, to his wife and two eldest sons. According to the Kellogg genealogy, this Sarah, dau of
Mary and Jonathan, described as Mrs. Sarah (Lockwood) Hickok married, as his second wife, March 9,
1755 in Wilton, Samuel Kellogg. The Kellogg genealogy says that Sarah married, first, January 25,
1700, Nathaniel Selleck who died in 1712 and at the time of her marriage to Samuel, she was in her
73d year, and he was in his 83d, and it may well be called, as it is in Selleck’s Norwalk, “the most
remarkable wedding that ever took place in Norwall”. Samuel died in 1757 and Sarah in 1765. In her
will, she named children mentioned Selleck and Hecox. In one genealogy record, Sarah is listed as the
dau of Edmund &amp; Hannah (Scott) Lockwood. (?) Born to them were (not in birth sequence):</div>
