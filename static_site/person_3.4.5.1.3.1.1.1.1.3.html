            <div class="person-text">(3.4.5.1.3.1.1.1.1.3) JOHN MARKOE FERRIS “Cookie” born April 22, 1905 Oregon and died
November 11, 1987 Los Angeles Co CA; wrote a pamphlet entitled, “The Exploits of John Markoe
Ferris”. From the pamphlet: “Accomplishments of John M. Ferris – Since 1942 the writer has
personally planned, organized and escorted more than 250 group tours to points within the United
State, Canada and Alaska. This figure includes no less than 80 special train operations. Using ALL
FORMS of transportation these tours catered to those who desired only the best in off-the-beaten path
adventures. Many of these events opened new paths for others to follow, many have never been
repeated, many can NEVER be repeated. In addition to my personal endeavours in the group tour field
I have enjoyed 22 years service with THE PULLMAN COMPANY (former operators of America’s

sleeping car system) in road, yard, commissary and stores departments. 10 years service with the old
LOS ANGELES RAILWAY MOTOR COACH DIVISION, as a student instructor and dispatcher, and a
stint as a supervisor with SANTA FE TRAILWAYS rounds out a rather full career in the field of
passenger transportation. Further, the writer is an accomplished motion picture photographer and is
well versed in public relations and advertising. All brochures necessary to the successful conclusion of
the events sponsored were produced by the writer.” “Memories of a Pullman Conductor: innumerable
trips to New Orleans via Southern Pacific’s work-horse The Argonaut; Troops trains galore from Fort
McArthur (San Pedro) to Fort Dix, New Jersey; working San Diego and Arizona Eastern’s daily train,
San Diego to Yuma; Navy trains galore from San Diego to Great Lakes Naval Training Center;
unforgettable trips to Chicago via Santa Fe’s Grand Canyon Limited; and one of my favorites, Southern
Pacific’s wonderful old West Coast Limited, a through train Los Angeles to Portland.” He married Ruth
