(1.1.3.1.4.8.4.1) RUTH FISHER born December 13, 1896 Hackensack NJ; attended the
Gateway private school in New Haven CT for 4 years, and upon her graduation, studied
at the Parsons School of Fine and Applied Arts. After spending a year or two painting
and designing gifts, she decided to go into business with a friend and start a gift shop.
This work was interrupted by her marriage, February 18, 1922 in Hackensack, to Luther
Locke Richardson [son of Thomas Franklin &amp; Nellie (Simons) Richardson] born
February 8, 1896, Clinton MA. He received a scholarship to Cornell, from Erasmus
Hall, Brooklyn. Upon their marriage they resided a few months in Boston before they
moved to Hackensack. WWI interrupted Luther’s attendance at college – he enlisted in
the Navy and served 2 years abroad as a chief petty officer on a submarine chaser.
During his enlistment he crossed the English Channel 59 times. Following his honorable
discharge he returned and completed his course at Cornell, after which he took a position
with the Texas Oil Company in St. Louis MO, but resigned and accepted an offer from
the Beacon Oil Company in Boston. Removing to Hackensack, he went into the business
of electrical supplies and radios, which seemed to have a good future, but he gave this
up also to become a bond salesman. He was an interesting talker, which he happily
combined with a gracious personality. She was known for her devotion to her family and
friends; having the happy faculty of combining the practical temperament with the
artistic. Born to them was:</div>
