            <div class="person-text">(5.1.2.9.10.1) ELIZA TRAVIS born January 4, 1814 Putnam Valley NY and died April 11, 1893; buried
Shrub Oak Methodist Cemetery, Shrub Oak NY. Obituary, Highland Democrat, Peekskill, NY,
Saturday, April 15, 1893: Under Adams Corners &amp; Vicinity: Miss Eliza Travis, who had been ill for
many months, passed away on Tuesday morning at the home of her sister, Mrs. Sarah Gilbert, with
whom she had lived for many years. She was the daughter of William and Ann Travis, and was the
eldest of a family of twelve children, eight of whom survive her. When a young woman she embraced
religion and united with the Shrub Oak M.E. church, and at the good ripe age of 79 years she died still
in the true Christian faith. Her whole life had been spent in doing and caring for those she loved; never
thinking of herself, so eager was she to make others happy. Her work is done and we trust that her soul
rests in peace. Interment was in the churchyard, opposite the Shrub Oak M. E. Church. She has a Estate
Probated in Putnam County, NY, #3371, it names her heirs as: Sarah Gilbert, sister of Putnam Valley,
NY; Henry Travis, brother of Putnam Valley, NY; Ebenezer Travis, brother of Putnam Valley, NY; Ann
Horton, sister of Putnam Valley, NY; Lorania F. Christian, sister of Peekskill, NY; John W. Travis,
brother of Peekskill, NY; Mary J. Denike, sister of New York City; William Travis, brother of Napa
