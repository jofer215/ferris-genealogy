Commander of the 11th New York Fire Zouaves, who was killed by a Confederate civilian in May 1861
after he removed a Confederate flag from a hotel in Alexandria VA.] “Jerry Was a Real Boy in Seven
Mile Creek – I born in a small village called Seven Mile Creek, located in the township of Lamartine
County of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. And I lived right there in Seven Mile Creek until I was fourteen,
experiencing the many adventures that small boys then encountered. In after years my two children,
Helen and Frederick, clamored for stories of my boyhood days, for they lived in a city, and the things

that I had done in Seven Mile Creek seemed curious and fascinating. Still later, my grandchildren
demanded the same stories. And to them, those other days when there were no telephones or
automobiles were even more strange. When at the age of seventy, I retired from my University
teaching, my children urged me to write down the stories of my boyhood days and thus preserve them.
I finally yielded, and so it was that I, a grandfather, seventy-five years of age, began my first book for
boys and girls about Jerry Foster, who is really myself. Often as I went along with Jerry toward his goal
of owning a drum, I closed my eyes and saw before me Seven Mile Creek, that village just past its
pioneer days. And I remembered my friends, the games we played and our band. All the adventures
in Jerry of Seven Mile Creek actually occurred, and I have told them as accurately as I could after a
lapse of sixty-three years. And I found my task so enjoyable that when I finished the last chapter, I did
so reluctantly. Very soon I began another story which will carry Jerry through his Academy days.”
