1918 Peoria, Franklin, KS; married October 25/26, 1857 IN, Alfred Crain, brother of George S., above,

quarter section of land from the Government for $1.25 an acre. He then returned to Mishawaka IN and
married Fannie; they then moved to Franklin County KS; following article was published in The
Ottawa Times, January 30, 1986. It was written by Fannie Crain in 1912 at age 77. It was provided to
the newspaper by Violet Crane Davis, Fannie&#x27;s granddaughter and provided to me by Jean Noble - Jim.
In March 1858 we left our eastern home and friends to try to make a new home for ourselves in the
wild west. We started from Elkhart, Ind., on the train, coming to Jefferson City. From there we came on
a steamboat to Kansas City, which was then a very small place. We stayed there overnight in a building
upon a high bluff on the bank of the Missouri River; slept on a prairie hay bed. A plank would have
been just as soft a bed. That was our first experience of Kansas life. We hired a teamster in the
morning to bring us and our few goods, which consisted of one not very large box and two trucks to
Peoria City as it was then called. The spirit of border ruffianism still existed when we came here and
we had to have a little experience of it on our way out. The driver stopped at a grocery store a little
back from the road to inquire the way. They supposed, of course, we were free state people and they
wanted to make us a little trouble. There was a drunken man who followed our driver from the store up
to the wagon and caught the horses by the bits and almost upset the wagon. There was a gun in the
wagon. The driver got hold of it and was going to shoot him but my husband and his brother, who came
here with us, held him and took the gun away from him. While they were holding him the horses
started, threw the man down, and the wagon ran over him. The last we saw of him his friends were
carrying him to a house nearby and we drove away as fast as possible. We stayed in Gardner that night,
the next day we came to Peoria, and arrived there about the middle of the afternoon.
There my pioneer life in Kansas began and here also commenced the long stretch of years so
full of both hardships and happiness. We were young, strong, able and willing to work, anxious to make
a home for family and ourselves. We felt that we were on an equal with our neighbors for we were all
poor. When we went to church and other gatherings we put on our best, which was generally a calico
dress and sunbonnet. There was a sympathy and kindness between neighbors and always a willingness
to help each other in times of sickness and distress or want. I love to look back and think of my old
neighbors now nearly all gone. Some few have moved away to other places but mostly all have gone to

their long rest. There are very few of the old-time settlers left here. Those that roughed it through the
Drought of 1860 and through the war. When we arrived in Peoria, we went into an old log hut near the
Marais des Cygnes River. It was a lonely place full of rats, surrounded by timber, and near an old saw
mill. We could hear drunken men cursing and swearing any time of day. When I was alone, I kept my
door fastened. Our bedsteads were made of poles and the bed ticks were filled with prairie hay. Our
goods box was our table and pantry. For teacups we used tin cups. We had two splint bottom chairs.
We used tallow candles mostly but sometimes had to make a lamp by putting grease and a strip of cloth
in a dish. Coal oil was so expensive that we could not afford it. It was 125 cents per gallon. We only
lived in that house a short time then build a small one-room house up from the river and timber. We got
a few necessaries for keeping house and very few it was. We had but very little money to start with.
We lived in Peoria until the next spring, then moved out to our prairie farm - a wild looking place with
only one house in sight. There was nothing but prairie grass and wild flowers to look at. But we got
along very well that year. We had an ox team, an old wagon, one cow and had a very good garden. We
had plenty of potatoes, butter and milk. We raised sod corn, enough for our bread and to feed the team
and cow. We lived on cornbread for several years for flour was an expensive luxury that we could not
afford. We made coffee of parched corn and browned meal. Sugar was beyond reach. Sometimes we
made our cornbread without soda. The year of 1860 was the year of the terrible drought. It was dry for
18 months though occasionally we had light showers but hardly enough to lay the dust, and such a heat
a burning sun and hot scorching blasts of wind that blew almost continually from the southwest. It
dried everything up. Water was scarce. We had a spring one-half mile from the house that afforded
water enough for our use and the neighbors would come sometimes for two and three miles to get
drinking water, sometimes they would come in the night, people that lived two and three miles away
were right-near neighbors then. We hauled water in a barrel for house use. Think of drinking water
standing in a barrel in such hot weather but it was the best we could at times.
The aid donated by the east kept many from actually starving, and kept many in the few clothes
they wore though we managed to get through without aid. Cornbread and butter through the summer
and a little thin poor meat through the winter was our living. Clothing was very light. We had but two
children then, both little ones. We had no money and if we had there was nothing to spend it for here.
Our mail was brought from Lawrence in the stage and we got it about once a week. In 1861 the war
began which still kept up hard times and we had our trails, troubles, and fears. My husband was often
called out with the militia to protect our home from the invasion of border ruffians and rebel troops. In
October, 1851, General Price and Raines invaded Kansas below Fort Scott on Drywood Creek. A battle
was fought there between the rebel forces and the Kansas troops under General Lane. Lane&#x27;s forces
retreated to Fort Scott. Fearing attack there he moved on to Fort Lincoln and called on all able-bodied
men of Kansas for reinforcements. They rushed to his aid. The rebel generals hearing of Lane&#x27;s
reinforcements turned and went back to Missouri and there was no battle. When my husband left home
to go to Fort Lincoln, our eldest boy, then 14 months old, was quite sick with Cholera Infantum. I often
think of that time and of my trouble and worry and will always remember Tau Jones. He was riding by
our house and stopped to get a drink of water. He saw my baby in the cradle and said, Sick baby. I
said, Yes, he is sick. He said he would get medicine for me that would cure him. He went out and
hunted in the prairie grass for roots, brought in two or three kinds, and told me to boil them in water
and give him the tea to drink. Give it often he said, a little at a time. I did as he said and the child got

better right along. I have used the old Indian&#x27;s medicine in my family a good many times since and
think it has done me a great deal of good. The Indians used to come here and want to trade with us.
They would have blankets and baskets and other notions to trade, for whatever they saw, they wanted.
But they were always civil, and well behaved. We were never afraid of them unless they had whiskey.
We used to hire them to husk corn and dig potatoes. The squaws would husk corn. They were better to
work than the Indian men. That year we raised corn and potatoes, enough for our living. Central&#x27;s raid
occurred on August 21, 1863. Lawrence was burned, plundered, and many of her citizens murdered.
They passed within 80 rods of our house on their way back. When crossing Walnut Creek one of their
men was shot and died by our fence. We saw his bed in the grass where he died. It was supposed he
was taken away by friends in the night. As they passed here, they had no time for their murderous
work as the soldiers and citizens followed them too closely. Our next fright was the Price raid in
October, 1864. Every man between 16 and 60 was ordered out to repel this invasion of Kansas. It was
supposed Price with his large Army would march right through Kansas, and that he would ravage and
burn all before him. The report of cannonading on Sunday morning was plainly heard which added to
the frightful condition. My husband was there. We heard all sorts of stories. We had some money and
some little treasurers. Thinking I might save them if everything was taken, I buried them in the ground
but soon the news came of the battle of Westport and that Price had been put to flight. Then the men
returned to their homes. I think that was our last trouble. At the close of the war the hardships became
less burdensome and we began to feel like trying to make our homes more comfortable. In 1875 we
had a pest of grasshoppers or mountain locusts. They were so thick in the sky that the sun had the
appearance of an eclipse. They lit on everything, eating all green vegetation. They left bare seeds
hanging on the peach trees, and where fine turnips had been there remained only hollow cups. Corn
was all eaten up or destroyed. That was the most discouraging time of my life - no money and no work
to make money or get anything to eat. We had at that time a large family of children. It seemed that
starvation was almost at our door. We had a half-bushel or more of seed corn left when planting was
over that I hulled and made hominy. We lived on that for three days. On the fourth day we ate the last
for breakfast. I said to my husband, What will we have for dinner? &quot; He said, &#x27;I don&#x27;t know, but we&#x27;ll
see what I can do.&quot; He went to Peoria and got a job for one of the boys to herd cattle, then he brought
home something to live on for a while. In a few days the grasshoppers left and we made garden the
first of June and raised a good crop.
At times we had too much dry weather for crops to do well. We had sickness and doctor bills to
pay, and a great many other discouragements, but through it all we were provided for in some way.
I have had 54 years of Kansas life and have spent 53 years of that time in one home as I have
never moved from the old homestead where we first settled. It is a long time. Of my ten children, all
are living but one; all have grown to manhood and womanhood; all have families of their own but one;
all live in Kansas but two. They are all kind and attentive to me and I have nothing to complain of.
Kansas has been good to me and I expect to spend the remainder of my days with her and sleep the
long sleep &#x27;neath her blue skies and green sod&#x27;. Born to them were:</div>
