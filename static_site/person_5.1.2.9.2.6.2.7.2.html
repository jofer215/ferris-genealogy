            <div class="person-text">(5.1.2.9.2.6.2.7.2) WILLIAM EBENEZER BARGER “Bill” born April 21, 1878 and died April 3, 1933
in his room at 108 Fayette Street, Syracuse NY; attended the Drum Hill School and later graduated
from the Eastman-Galnes Business School in Poughkeepsie; worked in a grocery store in Peekskill for
a time and then went to New York City where he became manager of the Broadway Billiard Academy,
this being 20 to 25 years ago. He learned to play billiards in Johnson&#x27;s Parlor, Poughkeepsie, when he
teamed up with a traveling salesman who proved to be an expert player. Barger proved to be adept at
the game and learned fast. Later Barger went to Albany where he managed the billiard room at the Ten
Eyck Hotel. Still later he went to Syracuse upon the opening of the Onandago Hotel. Resigning his
position as manager of the billiard room, Barger opened his own place, &quot;The House Of Lords&quot; in 1926,
this being at 305 South Warren Street. Ill health forced him to retire and he went to California to
recuperate. Returning to Syracuse, he worked at the Onandago Hotel for one year where he managed
the Jefferson Bowling Alley’s cigar stand for two years and then returned to the Onandago Hotel where
he worked at the cigar counter. At one time, he was known as the champion billiard player of Central
New York State. He was survived by his unnamed wife, who lived in California. Apparently no
offspring.</div>
