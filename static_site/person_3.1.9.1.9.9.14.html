            <div class="person-text">(3.1.9.1.9.9.14) ENOLA FERRIS (Photos) born April 17, 1863 Saratoga Springs NY and died October
29, 1948; buried with her husband at the Chestnut Grove Cemetery, Herndon, Fairfax, VA (Photo).
[One source has Enola’s middle name as Kathleen, but family says it was Jane, so no Kathleen]. Enola
was born premature and only weighed a few pounds at birth. Her family carried her around on a pillow
because she was so fragile. Enola was the youngest of 14 kids, and was spoiled by all. They say that is
why she was so spoiled and demanding all her life! She married, circa 1881/82, John Andrew Herrell
born May 28, 1851 and died August 11, 1895, of blood poisoning when gangrene set in after a severe
leg injury; he was directing someone backing up farm equipment, when his leg was injured by a grass
cutting blade; buried Herndon VA. Enola’s obituary reads as follows: Funeral services for Mrs. Enola
Kendall Herrell, 85, who died Friday at her home, 1854 Ingleside Terrace NW, will be held at 1 p.m.
Monday at the S.H. Hines funeral home, 2901 14th St, NW. Burial will be in Herndon VA. Mrs. Herrell
had been in ill health since she suffered a shoulder injury in a fall in her home five months ago. She
was a native of Saratoga Springs NY but moved to Fairfax County VA, in her childhood. For many
years her father, Orsanas Ferris, operated a brickyard at Fairfax Courthouse. Mrs. Herrell’s husband,
John A. Herrell, a farmer, near Herndon VA, died about 54 years ago; Mrs. Herrell had been a resident
of the District for about 40 years and had lived about 32 years at the Ingleside Terrace address. She was
a member of the Calvary Methodist Church. She is survived by two children, Mrs. Lillian A. Morris
and Charles Harvey Herrell, both of Washington; five grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. Born
to them were:</div>
