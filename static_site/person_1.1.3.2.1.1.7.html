            <div class="person-text">(1.1.3.2.1.1.7) DEAN FERRIS born September 30, 1866 and died July 6, 1935; married
1888 Ella Thompson born November 20, 1870/1 Brooklyn NY and died March 31,
1953. Dean was educated in the public schools and in the Pennsylvania State College,
spending two years in the latter institution. Leaving school at the age of seventeen, he
went into the greenhouse business. He acted as correspondent for several agricultural
papers, and for a number of years, was a crop reporter for the U.S. Government. He was
a member of the Cortlandt Lodge, No. 34, Free and Accepted Masons, of Peekskill, New
York; Thirty-second Degree Mason; member of the Lodge No. 744, Benevolent and
Protective Order of Elks, of Peekskill; and past master of Cortlandt Grange, No. 889;
member of the Columbia Hose Company No. 1; director of the Westchester and Putnam
Counties Fire Relief Association; a member of the St. Peter&#x27;s Protestant Episcopal
Church of Peekskill. &quot;1986-Early in 1885, a young couple by the name of Dean and Ella
Ferris bought a large tract of land at the corner of Maple Avenue, extending down to
include what is now Montross Avenue and Ferris Street. They bought the land from
Chauncey M. Depew, State Senator. This was a very bold, courageous step for such a
young couple because they had very little capital, and knew that they would have to
work very, very hard to pay off the mortgage, which Depew agreed to hold for them.
However, they were accustomed to hard work having been brought up on large farms in
the Town of Cortlandt, in the Watch Hill and Maple Avenue sections of the town. So
they built a large farmhouse on the extreme end of the land facing on Maple Avenue and
used all the rest of the beautiful flat lands for a truck farm. They grew vegetables, every
kind of vegetable there is, and trucked them into the City to be sold. Dean Ferris even
made horseradish, bottled it and sold it after receiving a patent from the Government.
They worked very hard on the land and as the children came along (11 in all) they, too,
helped with the work and the truck farm was very successful. At about that time (the
early 1900s) there were many estates in Peekskill and vicinity, which had their own
greenhouses or conservatories. It was very fashionable in the 1890s to have your own
conservatory and grow your own flowers and plants. One of these estates was the
Canfield Estate on East Main St. (former Harriet Beecher Stowe Homestead), which was
St. Peter’s School in later years, now being used for the building of new homes. St.
Mary’s Convent was another large Institution, which had several large greenhouses.
Several of these owners decided that they would like to tear down the greenhouses, as
time went on, because they were too expensive to keep up. Consequently, they contacted
Dean Ferris and offered him their greenhouses if he would tear them down and take
them away. Dean, being a very ambitious and far-seeing young man, accepted their offer

and he and several of his sons tore down the greenhouses and conservatories and
reconstructed them on their property on Maple Avenue so that they could grow
vegetables in the wintertime. Gradually, they began to plant some flowers along with the
vegetables and soon people were coming to the new greenhouses to buy flowers. They
were asked to make up funeral pieces and wedding bouquest as well. That is how Dean
Ferris started in the floral business. Gradually, they bcame so busy with the flowers that
they had to discontinue the truck farm and they gave that land to the Village, which
became the upper end of Depew Park, which is now Ferris Street, named for the family.
At about that time, 1917, the Village of Peekskill decided to widen Maple Avenue and
they needed some of the land on which the old farmhouse stood, so Dean tore down the
old house and built the present home on the property next to his store where the present
Ferris Family lives. The family worked very hard at the floral business, the children
sometimes delivering geranius, etc., on their way to Drum Hill School, and during the
Depression of the early 1930s it was very hard to make a living selling flowers (a nonnecessity) but they hung on and came through the Depression just fine. At that time, they
also opened a Lawn Mower shop on the premises and this developed into quite a
lucrative business. Dean’s eldest son, Victor, continued to run the business after his
father died at age 65 of a sudden heart attack which occurred in the shop while he was
making a funeral piece. Two of Dean’s sons had served in WWI and one son, Lee, was
killed in WWII; his grandson, Victor, also served in WWII. Born to them were [some of
these kids are also listed under Edward Seymour Ferris – be aware!]:</div>
