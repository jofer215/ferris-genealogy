(2.1.4.1.3.3.4) GEORGE M. FERRIS born October 15, 1850 Wethersfield, Henry, IL and died July
13, 1893 Stark Co IL. Family history says that George jumped over a fence and injured his toe, which

1877 in Stark Co IL Arthusa Stephens (Orethusa) [dau of Elijah &amp; Susan (Sanford) Stephens] born
June 12, 1852 near Peoria IL and died February 7, 1910; both buried Lot C-1, Osceola Grove

withstand disease, and though he performed the duties of tax collector a year ago it could be plainly

wife and five children, besides numerous brothers and sisters and other relatives who mourn his death,
and with whom the Republican sincerely sympathizes.” Born to them were [not listed below is an
