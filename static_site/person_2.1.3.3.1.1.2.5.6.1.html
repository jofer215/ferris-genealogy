&quot;Harlo Hakes Ferris - December 18, 1969&quot;
Here begins something the end of which time only will tell - the story of my life - the remembered past, that which has been
glued to my memory and which I think had value or at least durability. Carefully reviewed it might be tiresome long;
prudently pruned someone might patiently peruse the effort. Here goes!
To set the picture in time ancestry should enter quietly from the right or left wings - Here come a solemn figure even
now...Listen.
The Mother&#x27;s side of the picture is called HAKES - Hakes were mainly of English stock (with a Hakes genealogical
book I will add more in time. The name HAKES, evidently refers to the hake fish so presumably in the earliest days there
was some connection of people with fishes. These people evidently settled early in New England, originally farmers; in my
mother&#x27;s day many of them were lawyers and judges - I have run across them in Montana and Wisconsin, altho the name is
not very common.
FERRIS - is evidently an English name altho that name may be a corruption of some other. If I find out later, I will
add a not to this effect. It would seem that the people first bearing that name had something to do with iron- perhaps they
were iron workers of some sort.
The Ferris from which this humble subject came arrived in Wisconsin, Milton to be exact about 150 years ago - early
history of this will be added later- William Peck Ferris, the patriarch came to Milton by way of Chicago and Milwaukee by
canal and wagon. There he married .... Janes, related to the founders of Janesville. This family had..... children, Molly,
Ellen, Bessie, Will, Charles, Charlotte, Hiram and ..... As they grew up and married they gravitated into salesmen,
clergymen, professors, doctors, missionaries, but mainly business mangers - no farmers.
William Peck Ferris was much interested in education - a member of Milton School Board and I understand the man
who planted the trees on the school yard. His eight children all went to Milton College, a Seventh Day Baptist College, then
as now an excellent institution.
William Lewis Ferris on of these sons was my father, living on to 1909, when he died in Portland, Indiana - My
mother was Carrie Minerva Hakes, who came to Milton College as a supply [?] music instructor. She was a talented,
vivacious out going, young lady with a large retinue of admiring young men, whom she did not rebuff. Eventually she
settled on this Will Ferris and they were married at the Congregational church in Milton Wisconsin.
My father and his cousin Bert Walker set themselves in business in an egg packing concern right in Milton. Along
about that same time other brothers and brother-in-laws were gravitating towards the business and manufacturing world and
in time organized the Creamery Package Manufacturing Co. which became a huge company, a leader in this line of
manufacturing. Aside from a few years on a farm, my father was connected with this firm as plant manager and
superintendent all of his life.
However, after his marriage he bought a farm near Whitewater and lived there for several years. I born there on April
9, 1886 and lived there for several years, I do not know how many. I remember absolutely nothing about life there altho I
know that my mother, brought up in small city swirls[?] and social contacts was far from at ease in the rugged life of an
early Wisconsin farm.
In about my fourth, fifth year, I do know that I was sent back to be with my Hakes grandparents in Hornellsville, NY.
From there on my memories came into being and I had many delightful times [there] on Elm Street. In 1968, seventy two
year I returned, and ?strange? to [say?] identified the old red brick house immediately.
My grandfather, Judge Harlo Hakes, after whom I was named was an important man in the community and his home
was a social center. I remember the faces of many people, my aunt Evelyn Brown, my cousins the Dennis Family, who
grew up to be very distinguished people [grandchildren of Judge Harlo Hakes&#x27; sister Minerva Hakes Bennet, her daughter
Florence&#x27;s]. I remember the kindergarten in a first [?] home and the 1st grade in the public school. I remember walking trips
with my grandfather into the hills. I remember a fire close to our house and many and many small incidents. I still can see
them clearly.

My father at about that time was superintendent of small manufacturing plants of CPMfgCo at Mason City Iowa and
Morrison Illinois and strange to say I can remember not a single incident from either town. In 1892 we moved to Portland
Indiana and there I lived until 1903 and my family for 6 years more. [1910] In Portland we lived in four different houses,
each time moving up the social scale until we finished with one of the nicest homes in the city of 6,000 people. We were of
the Presbyterian faith then altho my father was originally Congregationalist and my mother an Episcopalian.
My father was 6 ft in height, a strong, powerful man, who played first base and pitched without a glove. He loved the
game and went so far as to give the town team its uniforms on condition that they would not play ball on Sunday. He had a
delightful tenor voice and sang duets with my mother who had been, in her city days, a soloist of note in Boston.
Neither parent joined the Presbyterian church [located just down the street at the end of the next block] but we four
children, Harlo, Paul, Harry and Margaret, took part in all of the church activities.
My father was superintendent of the CPMfgCo plant in Portland, which made butter tubs, about 1000 a day. There
were 75-100 men at work with the various machines. The tubs were shipped by railroad to various butter and lard producers
in the midwest.
On Holidays and vacations we three boys, after we were 10 years of age worked in the factory. Paul usually in the
warehouse, I at one of the various machines. Harry driving a horse or a truck. Our father showed no favoritism and we were
treated just as the other men were. In fact I remember being called upon to work in the center section with 8 small furnaces
when the weather was terrific and no man would work there. I fired a boiler for a week in burning Indiana heat when men
wilted under the heat. I remember well, I&#x27;m sorry to say a foreman of mine who took great delight in telling me the most
vile stories imaginable, some of which remain in the back of my brain to this time.
We kept a cow, sometimes two, a horse, and a flock of white leghorn chickens. Paul went to the pasture for the cow,
Harry milked her and I peddled milk at five cents the quart. Our horse was usually an ex-race horse and only our father
drove him.
In the church we were among those who did things. Mother at the organ, father directing the choir, and I for quite a
while back of the curtain pumping the organ. We put on an Old Folks Concert at one time, and I with Carrie Tate, sang a
Duett &quot;Dost thou love me Sister Ruth&quot; I detested the whole performance. Fifty eight years later I married her, my second
wife.
Our mother gave piano lessons and we were hush! hush! when lessons were being given.
Ours was a great house for sociability and my mother was an admirable creature at party planning. A feature of each
social occasion was Peas Porridge Host with music played.[?] She had invited people of all ages and social strata and
maintained that this many times was the cause of its success.
Ringling Circus came to our Town yearly and the tents were just a short ways from our house. We boys were there
from the beginning to the end and then we walked around where there bleachers had been and picked up change from
slippery pants pockets. [Coincidentally, later ,he and his family lived in Baraboo Wisconsin, home to Ringling Bros.]
We had the second automobile in town - a 1907 white Haynes-Apperson with red leather and top. [see attached photo
and add] Stories about that car could fill several pages. It was the law that when a man in a horse drawn rig held up his
hand the automobile had to stop and then we boys in town, went up to lead the horse past. Tires were a major factor and a
puncture every 10 miles was not uncommon. Before the car was delivered I spent a month at the factory in Kokomo
Indiana helping putting cars together. I can&#x27;t see that this was really of much value.
School years I will go over quickly for there is little of memorable delights there. We walked about 1/2 a mile to
school and then back after dinner. My father was a Shakespearean admirer and I was always secretly ashamed when he
gave readings from this dramatist before the High School students.
There were no football teams, nor basket nor baseball teams then altho there was a track team that did well. The
runners in their so called underwear bothered some of the women folk, as I remember.
Graduation was just like it was an still is and we finished with delight.
My particular friends were of all sorts. Ralph Raferty Rainy was a sort of a ruffian who was a great book reader. Later
he finished life as a hobo. Don Hall was our neighbor, shrewd, likeable. Married a pretty girl and became manager of a
local factory. Milo Jordan, a quiet red head return to the farm and was still living in 1968. In 1968, Carrie, my second wife
also of my class of 1903 returning to a class reunion found about a quarter of the graduates still living.

Like many boys I was quite bashful in the presence of girls and made no pretext of having one specially for my own
possession but there are a few names that linger on- Emma Emerson lived a block from us. I kissed her once In a game of
Post Office. Cecil Close was dark skinned and we wrote many notes to each other. Maude Spade was much too short but I
liked her a bit. In 1969 she lived in Washington, DC. Others were on the outside.
After we boys had worked for much of the summer we usually went to Bay View Michigan where we had a few
weeks of lakeside vacation. Strange to say perhaps fifty years later I found out that my future wife Reubey Ferris must have
been summering near at about the same time as we.
My mother was a delightful creature, vivacious, out going, and a good mother and wife. She possessed a sort of sense
of superiority over our common neighbors and with many friends yet had no very close friends. After my father&#x27;s death in
1910 she lived at various times in Oberlin Ohio, Waukesha Wisconsin, and Lakewood Ohio where she died at the home of
my sister [Margaret Ferris Fletcher.]
Now comes a section of time from 1903 to 1906 - College years. Supposed to be years of great delight and I failed
then to get great thrills and now looking back have no great stirrings of joyousness, altho individual events still bring happy
memories.
In the fall of 1903 with my brother Paul, I went to Oberlin College in Ohio. I as a Freshman and he as a preparatory
student in the academy [this is why we don&#x27;t see Paul in the Portland year book where his Sr. class should be. MEFLG] We
went there because of the fact that a relative on the Hakes side, Professor Coles [?] had once been on the faculty there.
Interestingly enough, over the years other relatives of ours followed suit. Until there must have been as many as 20 or 25 of
us, Ferris, Kimball, Walker, Anderson, and Belknaps they were but all with Ferris blood if not always name.
There at Oberlin College I spent 3 school years without any special ambition expect to get a degree and graduate.
College years were 5 in all instead of the customary four because I took work in music which gave me no credit but perhaps
with more delight and inner profit than certain per scribed courses.
I might add here that I spent but three years at Oberlin College and finished with two years later in Pommona College.
In Oberlin we, Paul and I, lived with a delightful widow and ate at a boarding house, where college girls lived and ate as
well. Most of our social life gravitated about this boarding house where besides just plain eating were parties and social
events, flirtations and courting. I had also my lady love there, named Inez Shakes. Both of us were untrained in courtships
ways and made little or no progress in this delightful art.
Class work was prescribed and elective; some of which I enjoyed and some was sheer boredom; one Trigonometry I
flunked but under a different professor found that it was indeed easy. My favorite courses was one on Shakespeare and
another on Italian History made memorable by the fact that the professors were both capable and enthusiastic.
School social events in those days were not much different I suspect, then those of present days. Dances and proms
and parties; skating parties in the winter and out of door picnics in the short warm spell that school life offered. Social life
not being prescribed but freely of choice perhaps had as much bearing on our future life and conduct as much that serious
minded educators considered essential. The fact that there were no automobiles or practically none in those days changes
the picture greatly.
Athletically I did nothing more that two course of physical training, altho I did play tennis often. I had a part in our
play Ralph Roiste Dorsty [?] a play from about Shakespearean times a very minor part. I being the not so bright son
(perhaps fitting my personality) there was one [?]side more than another of College life that attracted and interested me
most I suppose that it was in music in its various forms. Oberlin has always had a great love for music both in its
conservatory and its college life as well. I missed few musical attractions, student recitals, oratorios, orchestra concerts,
everything in which was music - Always I stayed to the end of the organ recessional and took great delight in Dr. Andrews
organ improvisations. For myself over the years I have tried my hands with piano, cello, bass viol. french horn, singing and
now (1970) with the little recorder - In none have I accomplished much but have had much pleasure in each as they have
arrived.
Many people of future prominence were in Oberlin during my years there. I might mention in passing that HH Kung
[?] later to become the treasurer of China. Percy Ebbot, president of the largest bank in New York City; Anna Louise Strong,
leader of American Communists and later living in China. Amos and Thorton Wilder, writer and theologians, ...later on the
cabinet of Woodrow Wilson, Martin Davey, later governor of Ohio.

Notes for CARRIE TATE LIEFFERING:
Harlo and Carrie were high school friends in Portland, Indiana. They actually sang together at the high school. They met up
again many years after Grandma Reubey had passed away, as well as Carrie&#x27;s husband, at a school reunion. They were
married in 1960 in Iowa and lived in Michigan where Grandpa had a ministry at Rockford, for a number of years. After he
retired for good, Grandpa and Carrie lived at the PL with very primitive conditions (no indoor plumbing or running drinking
water). Both of them loved the birds there and both wrote lots of poetry together. Carrie had children with her husband
previously, names not recalled at this time.
