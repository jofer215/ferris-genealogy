            <div class="person-text">(1.7.2.1.5) HANNA LAWRENCE (out of sequence – apparently 1st born) born July 8,
1758 NYC and died there October 3, 1838 – not listed in all sources; a talented poetess;
a lady of strong character and of forceful and determined views; a Quaker she was
opposed to war and as a patriot, to the British occupation; it is purported that she
deposited in the street in front of Trinity Church on Broadway, a favorite promonade, a
poem which she had written denouncing the character of British officers, which, when
discovered by one of them, caused considerable consternation; after the war many of her
poems were published under the pseudonyms ‘Matilda’ and ‘Cornelia’ in New York
newspapers; despite the remonstrances of her father, married August 16, 1780 in NYC,
Jacob Schieffelin III [son of Jacob &amp; Regina Margretta Kraften (Ritschaukrin)
Schieffelin II] born August 24, 1757 Philadelphia PA and died April 16, 1835 NYC;
buried in the family vault, St. Mary’s Church; joined the loyalist army and served as
Henry Hamilton’s secretary during the Rev War; he was captured in 1779 and held
prisoner in Williamsburg VA, escaped to Canada hwere in 1780 he was appointed
Lieutenant in the Queen’s Rangers by Henry Clinton; spent time in Montreal but
returned to NY and founded a drug company with his brother Lawrence in 1794;
founder of a mercantile house which bears the family name to the present day; in 1770
Jacob’s family settled in Montreal; following his father’s death, Jacob was apprenticed
to a Montreal merchant; 1776 at age 17, he went to Detroit and entered the merchantile
business; appointed secretary to the government in the Indian Department and
commissioned a Lieutenant in the Detroit Volunteers; the commission may have been
partly in recognition of his prior service for he appears to have participated in the Battle
of Bennington (August 1776); in any case his rank and pay were equivalent to that of an
officer in the regular army; in 1778 Sir Guy Carleton, the commander of British forces
in Canada, ordered Governor Hamilton to undertake an expedition to New Orleans and
enroute to capture the American forts in Illinois; leaving Detroit in October with

Lieutenant Schieffelin, the Detroit Volunteers, and a detachment of regular troops,
Hamilton recaptured Ft. Vincennes on the Wabash which had been taken by the Virginia
Ranges unders George Rogers Clark;however, while awaiting reinforcements there
Hamilton’s forces were surprised by Clark and taken prisoner to Williamsburg, Virgiia;
the following spring Schieffelin escaped and made his way to New York City which was
then under British occupation. While in New York City, he met and married Hanna.
Jacob was offered an appointment in the Queens Rangers; he declined, requesting
instead to be allowed to return to Detroit to settle his business affairs, thus he and Hanna
joined the exodus of other Loyalists who sailed from New York in December 1780; with
stopovers at Quebec and Fort Niagara, they arrived in Detroit the following spring;
following the disbandment in 1784 of the provincial troops, Jacob returned to Montreal,
was appointed government auctioneer, and became a very successful merchant; during
the winter of 1788-89 he traveled alone to London in an effort to secure compensation
for his military services; in 1794, he returned to New York, purchased the drug business
of his brother-in-law, Effingham Lawrence, which was established in 1781, and with
another brother-in-law, John Burling Lawrence, founded the mercantile firm of
Lawrence &amp; Schieffelin, wholesale druggists on Pearl Street; more info in
the Schieffelin Family Papers, 1756-1907, The New York Public Library (on line); Yale
U, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library also has Schieffelin Family Papers; plus
plenty of other information on this family on the ‘Net; and born to them were:</div>
