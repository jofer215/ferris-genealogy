            <div class="person-text">(3.1.6.8.3.2.3.6) JEREMIAH R. CHURCH “Jerry” born September 15, 1861 Brockville, Ontario and
died 1959 Pontiac MI; married March 9, 1882 in Bad-Axe MI during a great blizzard, Martha Mae
Newcomb [dau of a Canadian lumberman who fought in the Civil War] who died age 92y, just a few
days short of their 75th wedding anniversary; buried Colfax Cemetery. When Martha died, she was
wearing her third wedding band, having worn out the previous two during a lifetime of housekeeping in
Bad-Axe. Jeremiah’s account of the Huron County Fire, September 1881 as related by his
granddaughter, Anne Church Lawrason. “I have a first hand account of the Great Forest Fire of 1881 in
the Thumb of Michigan. I was taking a course in American Folklore at Michigan State University in
which I was to interview older family members, neighbors, etc., about any anecdotes or stories they
would tell. On May 1, 1948, this is what I learned from my grandfather, Jeremiah R. Church, one of
the few remaining people who actually experienced the fire that swept Huron County in September
1881. He said he was 17 years old when it happened (this is what he told me, but since he born in
1861, he must have been 20 years old.). May grandfather was always so calm and quiet that I was
surprised to see how agitated he became as he talked about ‘the great rolling of the smoke’. He said the
tall pine trees were stripped of their branches and then fell. The fire covered almost all of Huron
County and because of the terrific wind, everyone was afraid it would cover the whole state.
Grandfather said it was almost like a hurricane. All of the buildings in Bad Axe, the county seat of
Huron County where my grandparents lived, burned, except for the courthouse, which was built of
brick. Everyone flocked there for safety. Grandfather said there were dead animals lying all over. The
people packed their valuable belongings in trucks and lowered them down into wells and stood on
them. The summer had been so hot and dry, that some of them contained no water and others were only
about a foot deep. Grandfather said his brother Olive lowered a feather bed into the well and helped his
wife down. He had just gotten down himself, when the fire roared across the well and burned the hat
right off his head! Grandmother Martha Mae (Newcomb) Church, said that she was living in Port
Austin at the time of the fire, and that all the townspeople buried their clothes in the sand along Lake
Huron. They placed all their valuables in a huge steel safe. The wind changed just before the fire
reached Port Austin. Because the people of Port Austin were so grateful and felt so sorry for the Bad
Axe people who had lost so much, they sent them food, all prepared. Grandfather concluded his
account of the 1881 fire by saying: ‘I never want to see another one like that’.” Born to them were:</div>
