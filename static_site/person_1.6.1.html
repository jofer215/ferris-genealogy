Westchester County NY October 6, 1808; married c1737 Elizabeth Griffin [dau of John
and Hannah (Clark) Griffin] born April 24, 1723 and died at North Castle on January 14,
1789. John was the first Ferris in Bedford on April 7, 1747 when at a lawful town

for the year ensuing for the east side of Long Bridge&quot;. The Ferris Family was farmers,
and it is written the farm originally comprised six hundred acres. The crops were

Militia on April 27, 1777. He later built a new home near the site of the old one. He
died at the age of eighty-five from falling from his horse. A farmer, his remains lie in
the Ferris Cemetery on his farm (plot 7) and Elizabeth, plot 6 (Route 22 near North
