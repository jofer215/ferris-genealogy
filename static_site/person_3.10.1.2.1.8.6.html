            <div class="person-text">(3.10.1.2.1.8.6) LINUS M. PECK born February 3, 1818 Cazenovia, Madison, NY; entered the
sophomore class of Hamilton College in September 1838; sustained during his whole course, a superior
position as a scholar, and graduated in July 1841, receiving one of the highest honors of his class. After
leaving college, he taught a year in the Hamilton Academy, and subsequently pursued the study of law
until the Autumn of 1843, when he concluded to discontinue his legal studies and prosecute a
theological course, preparatory to his entrance on the Christian ministry. Having devoted a year to the
pre-requisite study of Hebrew and been duly licensed to preach, in August 1844 he entered the
Theological Institution at Hamilton NY, in the following October, where he took the regular course of
two years and graduated in October 1846. In the Summer of 1845 he had been appointed a tutor in
Hamilton College, and though the acceptance of the appointment was urgently requested by the Faculty
he respectfully declined it as precluding his immediate entrance on the duties of the ministry. He

married September 17, 1846 Cordelia C. Kendrick, of Hamilton. He preached in Lebanon NY for
several months prior to July 1847 when he commenced preaching to the church in Hamilton NY and
continued his labors there, with great acceptance until his death, October 4, 1847 at his parents home,
of the same malignant disease which a few hours afterward proved fatal to his brother; both having the
same funeral obsequies, and both being borne together to their last resting place. He naturally
possessed a vigorous and logical mind, and superior powers of anlysis. His intellectual training was
thorough and complete. He was kind-hearted, zealous and laborious, an excellent public speaker, and
distinguished for his chaste and manly eloquence.</div>
