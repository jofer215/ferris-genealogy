Notes for STANLEY KEITH FISCHER:
A letter he sent to his niece, Annette:
Oct. 13, 1997
Dear Annette,
I was involved in a play, &quot;Gilgamesh&quot;, when you wrote. I was playing an old man who had lived forever (type
casting). My name was &quot;Utnapishtim&quot;. He made a lot of long speeches, and it was more than I could memorize. Too bad. I
dropped out. Then I had time to get together the stuff you asked for. Jack will likely send you most info about the Fischers,
but I&#x27;ll send some of the info they gave us at the Blanchard family reunion. It was in 1985, the 125th anniversary of the
founding of Wheaton College (by your great great grandfather, Jonathan Blanchard. His wife was Mary Avery Bent
Blanchard, and your great grandmother Geraldine Blanchard Fischer was their 12th child.
A lot more is known about the Blanchards &amp; Fischers than the Ferris&#x27;s, but I&#x27;ll fill you in on as much as I know. Your
father (and I) were equal quarters German (Fischer), Welsh (Ferris), English (Blanchard), and Scotch (Morrison). Rev.
Walter L. Ferris was a minister in Iowa. Not much is known about his 1st wife, except that she died shortly after having two
daughters, Millie &amp; Harriette (Hattie). Rev. Ferris then married Margaret (Maggie) Morrison (my grandmother). They had
3 children, Jessie, Mabel (mother), and Donald. Millie &amp; Hattie were half sisters of Jessie, Mabel, and Don.

Rev. Ferris was a Congregational minister in Cherokee, Iowa, when he received a call to minister to a Congregational
Church in Pekin, Illinois (close to Peoria). The whole family moved there, and Mother (Mabel Ferris) went to high school
there. Then Rev. Ferris received a call to become Chaplain of Wheaton College, and minister of Wheaton College
Congregational Church. He conducted chapel services in the college chapel every school day, then he held church services
in the same chapel on Sundays.
After Rev. Ferris passed away, his widow (our Grandmother) came to live with us for the rest of her life. She loved to
play cards with Lizzie, and when Roger came along he became a third for their card games of Flinch, Rook, and Rummy.
Mother&#x27;s half sister Millie married Rev. Alvin Smith. He was a pastor at a church in Rogers Park, a suburb of
Chicago. They had one child, Mildred. She married Jim McMahon, and they still live in Florida. They had twins, who are
grown &amp; married now. Rev. Alvin Smith became an Army Chaplain in World War II. He was sent to an Army base in
Denver, but the altitude didn&#x27;t agree with him, and he died of a heart attack in Denver. Millie died shortly thereafter.
Millie&#x27;s sister Hattie married Donald Coates, and they lived in Grand Rapids, Michigan. They had two children,
Stanley &amp; Donald. I&#x27;ve often thought Mother got my name from Hattie. Hattie&#x27;s husband died before his children grew up,
and the family moved to Wooster, Ohio. I went to school at Wooster College my Freshman year. I don&#x27;t know what
happened to Stan &amp; Don after that.
Mother&#x27;s sister Jessie married David Haeger, who owned the second largest pottery in the U.S. They lived in Aurora,
Illinois, about 15 miles from Wheaton. Uncle Dave&#x27;s pottery factory was in Dundee, a short way from Aurora. Dave &amp;
Jessie had 2 children, Bob &amp; Helen (Honey). The stock market crash of 1929 hit the pottery factory of Uncle Dave hard (as
it did most businesses). The company went bankrupt, and Uncle Dave lost everything. He had to give up his house in
Aurora, and the family moved to an apartment house in Hyde Park, South Chicago. Uncle Dave became the manager there,
and they struggled through the depression. The Haeger Pottery reorganized and began production again, but without Uncle
Dave. He was quite bitter. He &amp; Jessie divorced in the late 1930&#x27;s, and Dave died shortly afterwards. Aunt Jessie died
about 5 years after that. Bob &amp; I were very good friends (still are), and I used to visit him for 2 weeks in Hyde Park every
summer. We used to collect autographs together - our prize - CONNIE MACK. Dick was a good friend of Helen (Honey).
Bob &amp; Honey came to visit us summertimes at our home on Lake Geneva. Bob got a job working for Sam Langdon, who
had the only insurance company in Wheaton. Bob was a straight A student all the way through school, and he picked right
up on the insurance business. He moved up from helper to partner, and when Sam Langdon died, Bob took over the
business. He was sole owner of a large insurance company. I&#x27;ve always thought that somewhere, Uncle Dave is very proud
his son had become the successful businessman that he once was. Bob married Twinks Sweeney, a girl I used to go with.
She lived just down the street from our house out on Jewel Road. Bob &amp; Twinks met at a bridge party I had at our house.
They have 2 boys, and one of them took over the insurance business. Honey married Tom Angell, and they lived in
Wheaton most of their married life. They had 3 girls and a boy. Tom passed away a couple of years ago, and Honey lives in
Florida. She was a longtime librarian at Wheaton Library. She still visits there.
Don Ferris was Mother&#x27;s brother. By the way, I&#x27;m pretty sure all of Rev. Ferris&#x27;s 5 children graduated from Wheaton
College. Don married a Texas girl named Fay, while he had a job in Texas. He was always overweight (see his picture),
and he died of a heart attack in his early forties. They had no children. Don was a typical fat person - always joking &amp;
jolly. He had a wonderful personality, and Mother says he was the most popular guy in Wheaton College. I used to have a
picture of famous football player Red Grange. It was inscribed, &quot;To Don Ferris - the greatest bull-shipper in the world.&quot; I
left that picture in Denver when I moved to Hawaii, along with my autograph from Connie Mack. Wish I had them back.
That&#x27;s about all I know of the Ferris family. As far as I know, nobody had bothered to research the Ferris&#x27;s, as they did
the Fischers &amp; Blanchards.
There&#x27;s one item I left out. Rev. Walter L. Ferris had one sister, Dr. Mary Ferris (see picture). She never married, and
when she retired she lived with a retired school teacher, Miss Brereton. After Miss Brereton died, Aunt Mary came to live
with us for awhile, out on Jewel Road. There she took Grandma Ferris&#x27;s place in the card game with Roger &amp; Lizzie.
Becky keeps herself busy every day working in the yard &amp; garden. She also sews a lot, and helps Maria with her
homework. She started reading to Maria when she was still a baby, and Maria is still a bookworm. She devoured 240
books during summer vacation. She&#x27;s just starting out in 3rd grade. She&#x27;s always been #1 in her class, and she loves school
(I loved only recess). Hope all is going well for you, Ray, and family. Say hello, and give my best wishes to Ray. I still
think of him as that Marine who came to visit you at Christmastime.

Love,
Stan
