            <div class="person-text">(3.1.2.1.11.8.2.2.3) REUBEY STATIRA FERRIS born April16, 1886 Grand Rapids MI and died
October 28, 1955 Stevens Point WI; buried Hancock Cemetery WI; attended Chicago Art Institute; was
a commercial artist for many years (Photos); married June 18, 1919 in Bombay, India, Harlo Hakes
Ferris (2.1.3.3.1.1.3.5.6.1) – see him for offspring

Reubey - Graduated from Chicago Art Institute, later conducted an art studio in the Fine Arts Building on Michigan Ave in
Chicago with her sister Mary. Travelled to China to work for the American Bible Society. She lived there with her sister
Mary Lydia Ferris Swan and Dr. Alfred Swan. Grandma Reubey painted many beautiful pictures during her time in China
and later in India as well. Family and friends as well as private and public buildings have the privilege of having her
artwork. The Park St Church in Grand Rapids MI windows were designed by her, executed by Tiffany Bros. There is a
Mural of &quot; If I be lifted up&quot; at the Milton Congregational Church, Milton, Wisconsin-dedicated to William Peck Ferris and
wife Betsey Ann Janes. John T. Ferris pulled together a photo collection of her work in 2004 for family distribution.
When Harlo H Ferris was in China, en route to India for YMCA work, Dr. Swan, who headed the YMCA branch in
Shanghai noticed a Harlo Ferris on a printed list of visiting citizens in Shanghai for Christmas. He thought it would be
funny to invite Mr. HH Ferris to Christmas dinner and sit him next to his sister-in-law Reubey. Little did he know that he
would be setting up a match that would last for more than 30 years of marriage. Everyone enjoyed the joke and Grandma
and Grandpa wrote for many months until he proposed and she accepted with a simple wired message of &quot;Coming.&quot; Both
were Ferris last name but could not find close relatives enough for any offspring issues. They were married in Bombay,
India and lived there for several years during Harlo&#x27;s YMCA service to WW I service men stationed there. After first son
Harlo Jr. born, they moved back to the US.
Reubey was very close in age to her sister Mary and very close in physical features as well. When Mary&#x27;s daughter Mary
Swan saw her Aunt Reubey in the 30s on a short visit to Wisconsin, she remarked &quot;Ohh, you have Mother&#x27;s hands!!!&quot;
Grandma Reubey died of cancer.
Reubey Statira Ferris was the second daughter of Reubey Statira (Tomlinson) Ferris and Jay Floyd Ferris. Floyd Ferris was
owner, operator of the Ferris Coffee and Nut Company of Grand Rapids. Her Mother, Mrs. Reubey S.T. Ferris, was niece
and &#x27;adopted daughter&#x27; of &quot;Deacon&quot; and Mrs. (Sarah Tomlinson) William Haldane. Mrs. R.S.T. Ferris lived with the
Haldanes a number of years prior to her marriage to Floyd Ferris and afterwards as well, she was later made heir to William
Haldane&#x27;s estate. Grand Rapids history identifies William Haldane as early founder of the GR furniture business and a
prominent member in the Park St. Congregational Church.
Reubey Statira Ferris had six brothers and sisters and also lived at the Deacon William Haldane&#x27;s home for a time on
Jefferson Street after the Deacon’s wife Sarah passed away. Her parents also had a home on Madison St. She and her
siblings were all baptized and active members in the Park St Congregational Church during their youth, singing in the choir,
etc. Reubey graduated from Grand Rapids High School. She recounted found memories of living in Grand Rapids during
those times. Reubey and several siblings were very musical, well written, and artistic. She worked in several media and
perfected pastels, water color and large oil mural paintings.
Reubey S. Ferris graduated from Chicago Art Institute in 1907, and later conducted an art studio in the Fine Arts Building
on Michigan Ave in Chicago, IL as a commercial artist with her sister Mary Lydia Ferris, also of Grand Rapids. In about
1913, she traveled to China to work for the American Bible Society. She lived in Shanghai for several years with her sister
Mary (Lydia Ferris) Swan and Mary&#x27;s husband Dr. Alfred Swan, of the Shanghai YMCA. In addition to her American Bible
Society work, Reubey taught painting on the side and painted many beautiful pictures during her time in China and later in
India as well.
She met Rev Harlo Hakes Ferris in Shanghai who was en route to Bombay India to work for the YMCA. [Genealogy shows
that they are from two different branches of the Jeffrey Ferris family.] After a brief courtship, they were married in
Bombay in 1919. Rev and Mrs. Ferris returned to the United States in 1921 after the birth of their son Harlo Jr. in India.
They had two additional children in the US, John Tomlinson Ferris and Mary Statira Ferris Gilbert, all three of whom are
alive today with active spouses, children and grandchildren. Daughter Mary Ferris Gilbert has inherited her mother&#x27;s artistic
skill and interest in stained glass design and has produced several lovely large pieces of work for family and friends.
Rev and Mrs. Ferris lived primarily in Wisconsin from 1921-1955 until Reubey&#x27;s death in October of 1955 from cancer.
Rev. Ferris had several different Congregational parishes across the state during that time, and summers were spent many
times on Michigan&#x27;s lakes. Reubey supplemented the meager minister&#x27;s income by selling her exotic and local subject
paintings and was commissioned to paint several murals in private homes, churches and businesses. The two windows at
the First (Park St.) Church, designed by Mrs. Ferris, are the only stained glass work renderings of her work that the Ferris
family knows of at this time. In 1937, benefactors of the First (Park St) Church in Grand Rapids MI requested that she
design two windows for the sanctuary. “ The Spirit of Music window
When Park&#x27;s 1929 remodeling created the chancel at the sanctuary&#x27;s east end, two small window openings, about
seventeen by forty-five inches, were left in the lower part of the bricked-in space where the displaced Tiffanys had been.

During the church&#x27;s centenary seven years later, two of its women were inspired to donate memorial stained glass works to
fill them. Tiffany Studios accepted the dual commission, but went bankrupt before the new windows could be made. Erhardt
Stoettner, head of the art glass department at Milwaukee&#x27;s T. C. Esser Company, finally supervised fabrication of this pair,
reportedly utilizing pieces acquired from the defunct firm.
Dorothy Stuart Blake and her three married sisters gave the north side window in memory of their parents. The Blakes,
some of whose descendants remained as Park members into the twenty-first century, had a long history of being active in
the church&#x27;s music department. The symbolic trumpeting angel, then, was an obvious memorial choice to stand for their
musical spirit. It was Miss Blake who suggested incorporating water lilies and gladiolus blooms, with what she called &quot;a
touch of the American Beauty&quot; rose color in one &quot;glad,&quot; to represent all three of the family&#x27;s favorite flowers.
Both windows, dedicated together on June 19, 1938, were assembled with highly translucent glass to bring light
into their rather dark comers. To be better seen by the congregation, they also were set as far inward as possible from the
outside walls. Their color scheme was chosen to harmonize with the Tiffanys already in place.
The Spirit of Flowers window
The south chancel window was commissioned by Ellen Lyon Baker, Park&#x27;s longserving &quot;Lady of the Flowers,&quot; who
had charge of floral arrangements on the church&#x27;s altars for more than four decades. She lived to celebrate her hundredth
birthday.
Because this window was intended for the new children&#x27;s comer, Mrs. Baker took special care when suggesting its
design. She specified that it must not depict a powerful angel, which she feared might overawe small children, but one
wearing a kind and pleasant expression that would appeal to them. It was also her request to have the flowers in the
foreground be white trilliums, a favorite of hers and of her husband, Henry, whose death had left her widowed many years
before.
The designs for both chancel windows were sketched for Esser by Reubey Ferris [Reubey Statira Ferris], a minister&#x27;s
wife living in Wisconsin, whose family connection to Park went back to 1837. (She lived with the furniture pioneer
William Haldane, who held office as deacon for a record-setting half century.) Her angel, like its musical counterpart across
the way, has the requisite sweet, youthful face. Both are treated in a slightly less realistic and more stylized manner than
Tiffany&#x27;s angels. To go with the trilliums, Mrs. Ferris carried over the water lily motif from the Blake window to make a
similar base for the picture.
Though not commanding the prestige that attaches to the Tiffany name and craftsmanship, this modest pair of
windows is charmingly designed and skilfully executed. They provide a bright, enjoyable complement to the larger
ensemble.

Other church artwork by Reubey Ferris can be found in the Hancock Congregational Church in Hancock Wisconsin; a large
mural &quot; If I be lifted up&quot; at the Milton Congregational Church, Milton 1934, Wisconsin-dedicated to William Peck Ferris
and wife Betsy Ann Janes Ferris - Wisconsin Ferris family pioneers; another mural was at the First Congregational Church
of Kenosha Wisconsin, painted in 1952.
Family and friends as well as private and public buildings have the privilege of displaying Reubey&#x27;s artwork. In 2004, her
son John T. Ferris made an inventory of Reubey&#x27;s work of over 120 watercolor, oil paintings and pastel works, of
landscapes, religious scenes, and everyday family life both exotic and humble.
The Ferris family wishes to thank the faithful members of the First (Park St.) Congregation Church for their careful and
loving stewardship of these meaningful pieces of historical religious art. We hope they continue to give you joy and
inspiration.
Sincerely, Mary Ferris Gray, granddaughter of the artist, Reubey Statira Ferris. June 2004&quot; Sent to First Congregation
Church historian, Jackie Johnson.
