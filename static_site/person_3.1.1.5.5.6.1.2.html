            <div class="person-text">(3.1.1.5.5.6.1.2) LIZZIE NEY MILES born March 14, 1850 Petersburg, Menard, IL and died there
February 7, 1937; married December 21, 1869 in Menard Co IL, Horace Alanson Wood [son of
Solomon &amp; Ann (Shewman)] born June 30, 1842 Lyndon, Cattaraugus, NY and died October 12, 1913
Petersburg, Menard, IL; both buried Oakland Cemetery, Petersburg IL (headstones photo)
&quot;Mrs. Lizzie Ney Miles Wood, widow of the late Horace Wood and a member of the pioneer
Miles family, died at her home Sunday morning, February 7 at 1:40. While Mrs. Wood had suffered an
attack of influenza in January, she had apparently entirely recovered and had been enjoying her many

home interests when she was suddenly stricken with pneumonia, the resulting complications of which
her unusual vigor was unable to overcome.
Mrs. Wood born in Petersburg on March 14, 1850, the daughter of James and Anna Smith Miles,
pioneer settlers of Menard Co; her mother had made the trip west from New York on a flat boat at the
early age of nine years, traversing the Allegheny, Ohio, Mississippi, Illinois and Sangamon Rivers to a
point near Chandlerville where the family resided and the grandfather became not only one of the
pioneer teachers of Cass county, but physician and pioneer preacher as well. Her father, James Miles,
born in White county, Illinois, emigrating to Menard when it was first made a county.
Something of the native courage and natural philosophy of Mrs. Wood&#x27;s inheritance was an
integral part of her life. When through an accidental fall she suffered a broken hip in September 1935,
this courage and philosophy coupled with a fine sense of humor helped to accomplish a recovery that
seemed incredible.
She grew into womanhood in this community. On December 21, 1869, she was married to
Horace A. Wood of Cuba, New York. To them were born three children, Florence, the wife of Dr. G.
W. Spears, Green Valley, Illinois, Beulah M. Wood, City Superintendent of Schools of Petersburg, and
Harlington, Springfield attorney and Judge of the Sangamon County Court.
Mrs. Wood had an abiding interest in the work of her church. Together with her husband she was
a charter member of the local Christian Church a fact very dear to her. She held membership in the
Petersburg Woman&#x27;s Club for many years and was one of the charter members of Pierre Menard
Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Her interest in current life was maintained to
the last.
It was hard to realize that Mrs. Wood had reached the ripe age of nearly 87 years because of the
fullness and completeness of her interests, but to her many friends and especially to her children she
has left a rich heritage of the pattern of beautiful living.
Surviving are the three children named above, two grandchildren, Mrs. Anna Ney Spears
Gidcombe of Green Valley, Harlington Wood Jr., Springfield, one great-grandson, John Spears
Gidcombe, two brothers, George U. Miles and James S. Miles of this city. Two sisters, Mrs. Mary
Miles Hurd and Mrs. Kate Miles Gray preceded her in death several years ago.
Funeral services were held at the First Christian Church at 10:30 Tuesday morning, conducted by
Rev. Clark Walter Cummings, pastor of the First Christian Church of Springfield, Rev. L. R. Cronkhite,
pastor of the church here, and Rev. W. M. Groves of Springfield, former pastor of the local church.
Pallbearers were Judge V. O. Whipp, John M. Smoot, Fred R. Henninger, C. C. Juhl, Harry B. Apken
and Powell Juhl. Burial was in the family lot in Oakland cemetery.&quot;
&quot;(1879) H. A. WOOD, nursery, Petersburg; H. A. Wood is a specimen of the Yankees of the
Empire State; born in Cattaraugus Co., N. Y., June 30, 1842; son of Solomon and Anna Shuman Wood;
the Shumans are of German and the Woods of English descent; Horace&#x27;s father was a farmer, and
reared H. A. to this business, after he had attained his manhood, was engaged several years as traveling
salesman, and was successful in this direction, and, attracting the attention of Mr. Spaulding, of
Springfield, he engaged his services and continued with him two years, with credit to himself and to the
satisfaction of his employers. Dec. 29, 1869, married Lizzie Miles; born in Petersburg March 14, 1850;
daughter of Maj. Miles; one child -- Florence, born April 13, 1874. Since his marriage, he has been

engaged in the nursery business on his own account; keeps a general assortment of fruit and shade
trees, shrubbery and hardy plants; Mr. Wood&#x27;s long experience in the business enables him to give
satisfaction to his customers, and from his upright and manly deportment, has secured the good will
and liberal patronage of the people. Is a member of the Christian Church.&quot;
&quot;(1905) Horace A. Wood, now living retired in Petersburg, was until recently engaged in the
nursery business. He born on the 30th of June 1842, in Cattaraugus County, New York, a son of
Solomon and Ann (Shewman) Wood.
Horace A. Wood began his education in the district schools of his native state and
afterward continued his studies in an academy in Rushford, New York. Later he attended a private
school and subsequently went to Poughkeepsie, where he entered Eastman&#x27;s Business College,
completing his education by graduation from that institution. On putting aside his textbooks he began
traveling for a nursery company, his territory being principally Illinois. Later he embarked in the
nursery business in Menard County on his own account and grew nursery stock for seven years. He
then dealt in nursery stock for a number of years and was at one time connected with a business of
manufacturing bedsprings and mattresses, following that pursuit for about thirteen months. He owns
seventy acres of land adjoining the corporation limits of Petersburg. In Menard county and this part of
the state was known as an enterprising and reliable business man, and whatever success he achieved is
due entirely to his own labors, for he started out in life on his own account with limited capital.
In 1869 was celebrated the marriage of Mr. Wood and Miss Lizzie Miles, a daughter of James
Miles [refer to biographical sketch for James Miles], and unto them were born three children, two
daughters and a son: Florence, born in 1874, is now the wife of Dr. George Spears, who is engaged in
the practice of dentistry in Petersburg; Beulah, born in 1881, is a graduate of the Petersburg high school
and has spent two years as a student in the State University of Illinois and is now teaching in Menard
county. Harlington, born in 1884, is also a graduate of the Petersburg schools and was a student in the
State University, where he pursued the study of law. He is now teaching school, but will continue his
law studies in 1905. Both Mr. and Mrs. Wood hold membership in the Christian church and their
children are also identified therewith. He gave his political support to the Republican party until 1896,
in which year he voted for William Jennings Bryan, but he has again become connected with the
Republican party and he is enabled to support his position by intelligent argument because he keeps
well informed upon the questions and issues of the day. He began life as a poor boy, but his financial
valuation is now creditable. His life has been one of activity and usefulness and has been characterized
by the most unswerving integrity and honor in all his business transactions and in his varied relations
with his fellow men.&quot;
&quot;Horace A. Wood, for forty-six years a respected citizen of Petersburg, passed away at his home
at 5:30 o&#x27;clock last Sunday morning, 12th instant, aged 71 years, 3 months and 12 days. He had been
in declining health for several years and for about two years last past had been confined to his home.
The funeral took place from the Christian church Tuesday morning at 10 o&#x27;clock and was largely
attended. Rev. A. I. Zeller read a lesson from the Scriptures, Rev. W. M. Groves offered prayer and
Rev. C. E. Smoot delivered the discourse. A quartette composed of Dr. Degge, Harold Smoot, Mrs. J.
M. Smoot and Mrs. Harry Apken, Mrs. Harold Smoot accompanist, rendered &quot;There&#x27;ll Be No Dark
Valley,&quot; &quot;Wonderful Peace,&quot; and &quot;Lead Me Gently Home, Father.&quot; The interment was made in

Oakland cemetery. The pallbearers were” L. A. Whipp, L. F. Watson, H. S. Houghton, J. M. Smoot, H.
W. Nance and C. W. Shipley.
Horace A. Wood born June 30, 1842, in Cattaraugus county, N. Y. He was a student at Rushford
academy, Rushford, N. Y., and afterwards took the course at Eastman&#x27;s business college at
Poughkeepsie. He came to Illinois in 1867 as traveling salesman for a nursery company, reaching
Petersburg on the 14th day of November of that year. On December 21, 1869, he was united in
marriage with Miss Lizzie N. Miles, daughter of the late James Miles. Three children were born to
them, Florence (wife of Dr. George Spears) and Beulah, both of Petersburg, and Harlington, of
Springfield, Ill., all of whom, with the wife and mother, survive him.
Mr. Wood united with the Christian church in Petersburg during the tent meeting held by Elder
D. R. Lucas in 1874. Upon the organization of the church he was made a deacon, which office he held
until his death. He was one of Menard County’s best citizens. A man of commanding appearance,
kindly disposition and courteous manner, he made many friends. In business he was honorable; in his
home was a kind and loving husband and father; in his church he was a man of unwavering faith and
ready for any work. In his death his family, the church and the community have sustained a great
loss.&quot; Made fortune-selling hedges (for windbreaks) all over Illinois.
