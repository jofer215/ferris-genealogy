            <div class="person-text">(2.1.4.1.3.3.1) EDWIN FERRIS (AFN:35ZN-FF) born August 8, 1842 Bradford, Henry, (Stark Co)
IL and died June 13, 1916 Plumas Co CA [LDS says he died at Last Chance, Lassen County CA].
Edwin lived in a cabin and raised cattle in the Plumas National Forest. Legend has it that Edwin had
chased sheep out of the meadows before they ruined the grass for his cattle and he died of a heart attack
on his way back to the cabin. He was found lying in the creek. Edwin acquired his education in the
public schools and academy in his native state. In 1864 he crossed the Plains, accompanied by a large
train; and in making the trip from Omaha to Verdi it took three months. He settled in Plumas and
Lassen Counties, CA, where he had large holdings. He owned sixteen hundred acres in Plumas County
and seven hundred eight acres in Lassen County. He was largely identified in the stock and dairy
business in both counties. In 1900, he moved to Reno NV and purchased the Frey ranch, consisting of
two hundred and eighty acres, almost adjoining Reno. Edwin served the people of Washoe County as
County Commissioner for six years, and at the general election in the fall of 1912 he was further
honored, to fill the same office for a four year term. He was instrumental in the building of the

Courthouse in Reno. His picture hangs in the lobby. He was also a member of the School Board.
Fraternally he was a member of the B.P.O.E. and the Odd Fellows. He married, February 24, 1864, in
Henry County IL, Lucretia Leonard (Photo) born December 11, 1847, Henry County IL and died
February 2, 1925, Reno NV. Both are buried at the Mountain View Cemetery, Reno NV (Photo). Born
to them were:</div>
