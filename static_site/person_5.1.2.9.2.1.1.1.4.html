            <div class="person-text">(5.1.2.9.2.1.1.1.4) ALLEN BARGER, JR., born March 8, 1881 Putnam Valley NY and died February 4,
1939; married Flossie James [dau of John C. &amp; Avella (Reynolds)]. Obituary, Star, Peekskill, NY,
Monday, Feb. 6, 1939: Allen Barger Jr., proprietor of Barger&#x27;s Jewelry Store, 924 South Street, died
Saturday afternoon at his home, 515 Decatur Avenue, after a long illness, Mr. Barger, known to
hundreds of people in the Town of Cortlandt and Putnam Valley as &quot;Al&quot; was in his 58th year. He had
been in the jewelry business in Peekskill for the past 42 years. He was a former member of the Board
of Trustees of the village of Peekskill having been elected on the Republican ticket. His death was not
unexpected. He had been in ailing health for several years and for the past several months had been
confined to his home. He had a growth on the brain from which he is said to have suffered severe pain
at times. During his illness, his son, Steven Barger, has been in charge of the jewelry store. Mr. Barger
born in Oregon Putnam County, on March 8, 1881, the son of Allen Barger Sr. and Catherine A.
Tompkins. When he was about six months old the family moved to Peekskill and here he resided ever
since. He attended the Oakside School, beginning when he was eight years of age. He continued school
until he was 16 years old, when he left to enter the employ of P.A. Peterson, jewelry, 924 South Street,
at the same location where his present store is located. As Mr. Barger often explained it, he accepted a
&quot;job&quot; and got a position because he worked for the small salary of $3.00 a week at first. During his
early days in the jewelry business, jewelers made all the wedding rings by hand as well as the old style
cable watch chains and lockets. He remained in the employ of Mr. Peterson until the latter sold out,
three and one-half years later to the Robert Valentine, of North James Street. Mr. Barger continued in
the employ until Mr. Valentine&#x27;s death in 1920 when he managed the business to Oct. 1921, and then
purchased it. In Nov. 1934, when Dr. Frank P. Tompkins, optometrist moved from the Barger store to
the Medical Arts Building, Mr. Barger renovated and enlarged his store giving him considerable more
floor space. Mr. Barger was a member of the Harmony Lodge No. 133 Knights of Pythias, having
joined it in 1902. He held a number of minor offices there and was Chancellor in 1907. Two years later
he was chosen District Deputy Grand Chancellor for the district. Ever since then his interest in the
order has resulted in his holding offices in that lodge. He was also a member of Harmony Temple No.
29 Pythian Sisters, the women&#x27;s auxiliary of the order. He was a member of Delancy Cole Camp No 78.
Sons of Veterans, for many years and served as its treasurer. He was adopted into Bald Eagle Tribe No

264 Improved Order of Red Men in Dec. 1917 and served through its chairs and became Sachem of the
Tribe. He was a member of Cortlandt Hook &amp; Ladder Co. No. 1 of the Peekskill Merchants Association
and also of the Peekskill Rotary Club. He was elected Village Trustee in 1929 and served to 1932 when
he resigned declining a re-nomination. He also served a number of years as Town Auditor of the town
of Cortlandt and at one time was Registrar of the Vital Statistics. He was a member of the Van Nest
Reformed church. Mr. Barger was an ardent fisherman and this was one of his hobbies outside of his
membership in the Rotary Club. On Nov. 3rd, 1909 he married Flossie James, daughter of John C.
James of Lake Mohegan. He had one son, Stephen Barger. Other survivors in addition to the widow
and son are two brothers, Aaron T. Barger of Yonkers and Elmer Barger of Oregon. Interment made in
Hillside cemetery. Born to them was:</div>
