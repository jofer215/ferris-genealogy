            <div class="person-text">(3.1.9.1.9.4.2.10.1) CLARENCE BYRON FERRIS born December 8, 1901 Jackson, Jackson, MI and
died there October 3, 1972; buried there Roseland Cemetery; attended the Austin Blair School, on
Cooper Street, directly across the street from his home; left school in the 8th grade and lived at home
until his marriage; married June 26, 1926 in Jackson, Blanche Lucille Reed [dau of Thomas Jefferson
and Gertrude (Coil) Reed] born November 5, 1901 Yorktown, Delaware, IN and died February 17,
1970 Jackson MI; buried with husband. They set up housekeeping on Wisner Street in Jackson, but
later moved to a nearby lake area known as Vandercook Lake after the birth of Barbara. About 1932,
Clarence was laid off from his work at Mechanical Products and the depression years were closing in.
Blanche worked for awhile, but was soon laid off also. The depression years were hard and many times
they were forced to move as they could not pay rent, but somehow they always got by. They lived in
Vandercook for about 10 years and then moved to Jackson on Woodbridge Street; at this time Clarence
was working for the W.P.A., it was very little money, but with Blanche taking in ironings they got by.
They moved again to Francis Street, over a grocery store for a short time, then to 327 Biddle Street,
still in Jackson. About this time, Clarence got a job driving a truck for a candy wholesale supply
company and this was better pay and helped the family greatly. Blanche did housework to help the
family income. Clarence then went to work for Teer-Wickwire and later to Clark Equipment Company,
Jackson, from which he retired in 1967. They moved to Greenwood Avenue and later back to the same
home on Biddle Street. Later, they bought a home in Vandercook. Born to them was:</div>
