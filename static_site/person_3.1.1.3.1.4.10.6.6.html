buried at the Iaeger Memorial Cemetery, Roderfield WV; worked from the time he was nine years old
to help support the family. His high school years were not exemplary and in fact he liked to tell the
story of the day that he graduated. He received his diploma and his mother remarked to him as soon as
she could get near him, &#x27;Let&#x27;s get out of here before they change their minds&#x27;. Lewis spent the next few
years working and traveling around New England and even headed west for a time. Lewis graduated
from Cooper Union Institute, June 4, 1936, B.S., Civil Engineering. He won the Physics prize 3 years
in a row. Working nights and attending classes during the day, he completed the 5-year course in 4
years, graduating with honors; of about 100 who began the course the first year, only 16 graduated. He
worked for Semet-Solvey, a division of Allied Chemicals who sent him to Kingston WV. He moved to
Welch in 1940 and later started his own civil, mining, construction and consulting engineering business
there and served as City and County Engineer, McDowell County, a position he held until his death.
Lewis was a well-respected businessman known throughout the State of West Virginia and into
Virginia, Tennessee and Kentucky. He was licensed in West Virginia, Virginia and Kentucky. There are
many bridges in the area that he built on which his name is engraved. He was a member of the Lions
Club. He married June 19, 1937 at the Methodist Episcopal Church in Ashland KY, Doris Louise
Breen (Photograph) born December 10, 1911 Jersey City NJ; baptized there December 19, 1911 St.
Mary&#x27;s Church. Doris was a singer, teacher and leader. She worked for New York Telephone and sang
in the Bell Choir; studied piano with St. Mary’s Sisters of Charity, voice with Serafina Stralova (of the
Met.), religion at St. Mary&#x27;s and St. Aloysius and later at Montreat NC, where she also studied early
childhood education. She taught kindergarten for 16 years in Welch at the Presbyterian Church and
conducted three choirs at the Anderson Memorial Church, Stewart Street, Welch WV. They owned a
home at 403 Stewart Street, Welch and his children all grew up knowing his love and his fabulous
sense of humor. Doris now lives in Pompano Beach FL where she has taken up the game of golf and
