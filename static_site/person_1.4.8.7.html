also the use of my one half part of land purchased in company with Thomas Pearsall of
William Hawley lying on the north side of Cherry Street and running through to

same to her children; all the residue of my estate and outstanding debts I request my
executors will collect and turn into cash, and lay the same out in Bank Stock, one half in
the stock of the United States, the other half in the stock of the Bank of New York; and
to purchase the stock when they shall judge it best for the interest of my daughter; and

children of my sisters Ann, Martia, Barsheba, Euphemia and Phila to be equally divided
