morning destroyed a large two-story frame house owned and occupied by Mr. &amp; Mrs. George Myers
here. The fire is believed to have started from an overheated chimney. Mr. Myers discovered it in the
living room downstairs, but the flames had burned through the roof and attic and gained so much
headway, that local firemen were unable to extinguish them. A high wind was blowing at the time.
Almond firemen assisted by about 50 volunteers carried most of the furniture from the first floor and
kept the flames from spreading to adjacent buildings. A large barn, 100 feet from the house was saved
by their diligent efforts. The home was located on Maple Ridge, opposite the Erie depot. All the
second floor and cellar contents were destroyed. The house was partially covered by insurance, and the
contents fully covered. (Almond NY is in Allegany Co.---The Evening Tribune Newspaper which
contains this article is published in Hornell, Steuben Co, NY]” “27 March 1962--Hornell
