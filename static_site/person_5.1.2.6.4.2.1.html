            <div class="person-text">(5.1.2.6.4.2.1) MARYETTE FERRIS born c1825; married c1853, Hezekiah Stow (Stowe); one source
believes they divorced or he deserted her and the children;
Jim, I do have reason to believe that Hezekiah Stow/e and Maryette Ferris divorced. Here is my information and research so
far on the subject. It is long, I apologize, but it is circumstantial, so I know no other way to present it to you. I have an
ancestor, Hezekiah Stow/e who married on March 3, 1859 in McGregor, Clayton County, Iowa, Mary Sparks. Mary Spark&#x27;s
parents and most of her 12 brothers and sisters lived in Clayton Co., Iowa at the time. There is only one other Stow/e family
in Clayton Co., Iowa at the time and I can prove that they are not Hezekiah&#x27;s parents. My Hezekiah Stow/e is on the 1860
Clayton Co., IA. census with his wife Mary and infant son, James Niles Stow/e, living right next door to Mary&#x27;s mother,
Elizabeth Sparks and some of Mary&#x27;s sibs. My Hezekiah Stow/e and family are on the 1870 Pleasant Grove, Olmsted
County, MN census living in the same tiny hamlet as Mary&#x27;s mother and several of Mary&#x27;s married sibs. On the 1875 MN
state census, Hezekiah is missing and Mary is listed as a widow. When I first starting researching Hezekiah Stowe, all I
knew about him was what I got from the 1860 and 1870 census records. He was born in New York between 1828-1835.
First, I looked for him on the 1850 Federal census. This was before the computer. I used census records at the MN Historical
Society, National Archives, and WI Historical Society. For the 1850 census, only the Heads of Households were indexed. I
soon found Hezekiah Stowe in Prattville. He was married, so I thought not mine. He was the only Hezekiah Stow/e listed as
Head of Household in any State on the 1850 census. So, I figured my Hezekiah Stowe was living with his parents. I was
determined to find him and Minnesota did not have the census records for every State. (I live in MN.) However, the
Wisconsin Historical Society Library did have every Federal census for every year for every State. I spent two weeks in
Madison, Wis looking at EVERY SINGLE Stow, Stowe, Stone, Stone, Stoe, etc household in every State on the 1850
census. Believe me, Hezekiah Stowe in Prattville, NY is the ONLY Hezekiah Stow/e on the 1850 census in ANY STATE.
My ancestor&#x27;s name is Hezekiah Niles Stowe, so I also checked for any Niles Stow/e, H. Stow/e, N. Stowe, H.N. Stow/e that
could be him---NOTHING. So, I went back to the Hezekiah Stowe in Prattsville. He wasn&#x27;t on the 1860 census, but it

appears that his wife was, interesting. He wasn&#x27;t on the 1870 or 1880 New York census either. On the 1850 census, the
Roswell Ferris listed in the household above Hezekiah Stowe caught my eye. Hezekiah named his son, Roswell! Sure
enough Maryetta Stowe was living with Roswell Ferris on the 1860 census. I followed Roswell Stowe thru census records
and he appeared to disappear by 1900, so I ordered the death certificate for Roswell Stowe, guessing his death date. Sure
enough, he died May 23, 1889 in Ashland. On his death certificate it said that his name was Roswell Denis Stowe, he was
born in Prattsville, his father&#x27;s name was Hezekiah Stowe born in Cohoes, N.Y. and his mother was Maryetta Stowe born in
Ashland, N.Y. I guessed that his grandfather Stowe might be Dennis Stowe and he was named for his two grandfathers. So,
I checked the Cohoes, Albany Co. census and was excited to find a Dennis Stowe there who was old enough to be his
grandfather. Next, I wrote to Greene County to look for a divorce decree for Hezekiah Niles Stow/e and Maryetta Ferris
Stowe. They immediately sent me an automated reply that said it might take them a year to answer my request. Sure
enough, exactly one a year later I received a standard reply that they found nothing. I don&#x27;t really trust that is accurate, (for
the obvious reasons) and also because I have since learned that the old Greene county divorce records are not indexed.
Then, more recently on the internet, I found a probate record for Giles Sutton. His will was written May 29, 1855 and he
listed, &quot;to granddaughter Maryetta Stowe, child of my daughter Eleanor, now deceased, $90.00.&quot; Also, given was
information taken from the newspaper when the will was probated, Feb. 1857, named as Heirs In Law -- in Newspaper
Legal Notice: &quot;Maryetta Stowe, granddaughter, wife of Hezekiah Stowe, of Prattsville.&quot; So, all this was interesting, but it
really didn&#x27;t help me. I was stuck. Several years went by and one day on the Stowe Rootsweb Surname List a woman from
Washington State posted a query. (She got the following information about her ancestor from a partly filled out DAR
application --filled out in the 1920&#x27;s) Her ancestor, Henrietta Stowe Ostrum was born in 1832 in Cohoes, N.Y. Her father
was Dennis Stowe and she had siblings named Schuyler/Frank Stowe, Hezekiah Stowe, and Elizabeth Stowe. Henrietta
married David Ostrum in Cohoes? and moved to N.J. They had several children (she listed them by name) and then David
Ostrum died about 1863 in N.J. or N.Y. Henrietta Stowe Ostrum and her five small children then moved between 1864-1869
to Pleasant Grove, Olmsted Co Minnesota. The woman in the query stated that she didn&#x27;t know why Henrietta moved West
with her five children but she speculated that maybe Henrietta had family there. Well, I almost died! I have been to Pleasant
Grove, Olmsted Co., MN because that is where my Hezekiah Stowe lived from about 1861 to his death about 1874 and it is
TINY. I checked the census records and sure enough, there was Henrietta Ostrum in Pleasant Grove in 1870 and every year
thru 1900. She died in 1906. So, what about Hezekiah Stow/e in Prattsville? Did he get a divorce or just leave, because I
believe that he is the same man who married in 1859 in Iowa and moved to Pleasant Grove, MN where he died about 1874.
Statistically the chances that it is just a coincidence that Henrietta Stowe Ostrum (who also coincidentally HAD a brother
named Hezekiah Stowe) moved alone across the country with five small children and JUST HAPPENED to land in a tiny
little town where ANOTHER UNRELATED Hezekiah Stowe (also born in N.Y.) lived, is highly unlikely, especially given
how hard a time I had finding ANY Hezekiah Stow/e on the 1850 census in any State. So, this is my research information,
circumstantial evidence, so far. I have not been able to find anything additional on Maryette Ferris Stow/e and I was hoping
that you maybe had something. Thanks, Nancy
