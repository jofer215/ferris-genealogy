            <div class="person-text">(3.1.2.3) PETER FERRIS born April 21, 1725 Greenwich CT and died April (7?)17, 1816 (age 92)
(1815, age 93) Panton VT; buried there at the Adams Cemetery; removed to Crum Elbow, Dutchess,
NY by 1757 {on the tax roll from February 1755 through 1763} and later 1765/1766 moved to
Vermont. Peter made the trip to Vermont with his (2d?) wife and carrying an infant in his arms, to the
shore of Lake Champlain. After leaving the occupied country in New York, they plunged at once into
forest, and during the whole route, camping in woods five nights, they saw only two cabins of the
pioneers, one in Shaftsbury and the other in Danby. In this long and arduous journey, they drove before
them two cows, the first probably introduced into that part of the country. [Jim - this may be the Peter
Ferris, from Stanwich, who served in the King George’s War, 1744-1748.] Peter was the Representative
of Panton, 1786-87; married 1st February 26, 1748 Hannah Benedict [dau of Peter and Mary (Parish)
Benedict]; 2d a Miss Benedict {died in Panton before the Rev. War and was the first adult white person
buried in the town}; 3d a Miss Squires [dau of Jonathan Squire of Nine Partners] who died by 1776
Panton VT; and 4th February 1784 widow Hester (Dudley) Everest born July 3, 1723 Saybrook CT and
died April/May 1805 Panton VT. [Jim - there is conflicting information on the sequence of the above
wives and even the names of wives 2 and 3.] From History of the Town of Middlebury in Addison
County, Vermont (1859) - - In October 1776, upon the retreat of General Arnold up the lake with the
American fleet, after the battles fought near Valcour Island, he ran the remaining vessels, four gunboats and the galley, ‘Congress’, which Arnold himself commanded, into a small bay which still bears
the name of Arnold’s Bay, and the shores of which were upon Mr. Ferris’ farm. Some of the remains of
those vessels are yet visible, though they were all partly blown to pieces and sunk when Arnold
abandoned them. An incident of their destruction, not known to history, is related by Squire Ferris, a
son of Mr. Ferris, then in his fourteenth year. Lieutenant Goldsmith of Arnold’s galley had been
severely wounded in the thigh by a grape shot in the battle near Valcour Island, and lay wholly
helplessly on the deck when the order was given to blow up the vessels. Arnold ordered him removed
to the shore, but by some oversight he was neglected and was on the deck of the galley when the
gunner set fire to the match. He then begged to be thrown overboard, and the gunner, on returning from
the galley, told him he would be dead before she blew up. He remained on deck at the explosion and his
body was seen blown into the air. His remains were taken up and buried on the shore. To the credit of
Arnold, he showed the greatest feeling upon the subject, and threatened to run the gunner through on
the spot. The British fleet arrived at the mouth of the bay before the explosion of Arnold&#x27;s vessels and
fired upon his men on the shore, and upon the house of Mr. Ferris, which stood near the shore. Some
grape shot and several cannon shot struck Mr. Ferris’ house. Mr. Ferris and his family returned with
Arnold to Ticonderoga, from whence they afterward went, for a short time for safety, to Schaghticooke
in the State of New York. All Mr. Ferris’ moveable property at Panton VT was either taken or destroyed
by the British. His cattle, horses, and hogs were shot and his other property was carried off. His
orchard trees were cut down, his fences burnt, and nothing left undestroyed but his house and barn.
After some weeks had elapsed, Mr. Ferris returned to the remains of his property and endeavored to
repair his injuries, as far as possible. He has restored his fences to preserve a crop of winter grain
sowed the previous autumn, and had got in his spring crops, when in the month of June following, the

army of General Buygoyne came up the lake. A considerable portion of the army, commanded by
General Fraser, landed at Mr. Ferris’ farm, encamped there for the night. Two hundred horses were
turned into his meadows and grain fields, and they were wholly ruined. General Fraser had the civility
to promise indemnity, but that promised yet waits for its fulfillment. In the autumn of 1776, Mr. Ferris
and his son, Squire Ferris, assisted in the escape of Joseph Everest and Phineas Spaulding from the
British schooner, Maria, of sixteen guns, they lying at anchor off Arnold’s Bay. These two men were
Americans who had been seized at Panton and Addison and made prisoners for favoring the American
cause. Both were taken from the schooner on a dark night and conveyed to the shore in a small canoe.
Squire Ferris, the son, was also of a small party in the winter of 1776-77, who seized upon two
Englishmen, supposed to be spies, near the mouth of Otter Creek, and delivered them into the hands of
General St. Clair at Ticonderoga. In the year 1778, the British made a general capture of all the
Americans they could reach on the shores of Lake Champlain who were known to be friendly to the
Revolutionary cause. In November of that year, Mr. Ferris and his son started a deer hunt on the west
side of the lake. When near the mouth of Putnam&#x27;s Creek, about six miles south of Crown Point, they
were seized by a body of British soldiers and Tories, commanded by Colonel Carleton, and carried on
board the schooner, Maria then lying at Crown Point, near the mouth of Bulwaggy Bay. They were the
first prisoners taken in the great attempt of the British to sweep the shores of the lake of those
inhabitants who were friendly to the republican cause. On the same night, detachments of this vessel
burnt nearly all the houses along the lake from Bridgeport to Ferrisburgh, making prisoners of the male
inhabitants, and leaving the women and children to suffering and starvation. Mr. Ferris’ house and all
his other buildings were burnt. Forty persons were bought on board the next day, and within a few
days, the number reckoned two hundred and forty-four, part of which were put on board the
schooner Carleton of sixteen guns, which then lay at the mouth of Great Otter Creek. The forces,
which came out of the Maria and Carleton, were originally destined for an attack on Rutland, but their
object having become known by the escape of the American prisoner, Lieutenant Benjamin Everest,
that project abandoned, and they were employed in desolating the country and stripping it of its
inhabitants. The vessels proceeded with their prisoners to St. Johns; from thence they were marched to
Sorel, and it was the intention of the captors to have continued their march down the St. Lawrence to
Quebec. At Sorel they crossed the St. Lawrence, and soon after a heavy snowstorm came on, making it
impossible to continue the march. Trains were seized in all directions and on these they were driven to
Quebec. Here they were confined in prison. Soon after some of them contriving to escape, they were
divided, and about one hundred of them were sent down the river one hundred miles and employed in
getting out timber for building barracks. Mr. Ferris and his son were sent among this number in the
month of January 1779. In the spring following, nine of the prisoners, among whom were Mr. Ferris
and his son, seized a batteau in the night, in which they crossed to the east side of the river where it was
fifteen miles wide. On landing they set the batteau adrift, separated into two parties and made the best
of their way up the river. They had brought provisions with them, and avoiding the settlements, and
traveling only at night, the party with which the two Ferrises remained, arrived opposite the Tree Rivers
on the fourth day. They crossed in the night but were discovered and retaken. The remainder of the
party did not get so far, having been retaken by a body of Indians in the neighborhood of Quebec. The
party of the Ferrises was put into jail at Three Rivers where they remained for eighteen months. During
this time they made one attempt to escape but were discovered and were then placed in a dungeon for

seventy-two days. At this time, father and son were separated. Squire Ferris, the son, describes the
dungeon where he was confined as an apartment eight feet by ten and so low he could not stand up in
it, and that the one occupied by his father enjoined it, and was of the same character. The only light
was admitted by a small hole about eight inches by ten inches in size, which was crossed by iron grates.
The hole, which admitted this light was level with the ground, and the water from the eaves of the jail
poured through it into the dungeon whenever it rained. The straw given them to sleep on was frequently
wet in this way, and the confined air, dampness and filth, not be avoided, made their sufferings of the
severest kind. While they were confined here, another place was prepared for them, to which they were
transferred after the dungeon suffering of seventy-two days. This place was opposite the guardroom,
and upon being removed to it, they were told, “You damn rebels, you can’t get out of this”. Here the
father and son were again put together in the same room. The place was not however so impregnable as
was supposed, for in about six weeks the prisoners made an excavation under the wall, in the night, and
made their escape. There were six prisoners in the room at this time. Upon escaping the prisoners
separated, Mr. Ferris and his son remained together. They went up the river, nearly opposite Sorel,
where, two days afterward they crossed the St. Lawrence in a canoe and took to the woods. Their
design was to reach New Hampshire, but having lost their in the woods they struck the Missisque
River, down which they went a few miles, and were again retaken by a British guard, who were with a
party getting out timber, and by them were again carried prisoners to St. Johns. They were taken
twenty-one days after their escape, and had been nineteen days in the woods, during all which time
they had only a four pound loaf of wheat bread, one pound of salt beef and some tea for food. They
made their tea in a tin quart cup, and produced fire by a flint and the blade of a jack knife. For four
days before they were retaken, they had nothing for food but tea and were so weak they could hardly
walk. The forces at St. Johns were then commanded by Colonel St. Leger, a brutal drunkard, who
ordered the prisoners to be ironed together, and put them in a dungeon for fourteen days. At the end of
which time, and ironed hand in hand to each other, they were sent to Chamblee, and from there by the
rivers Sorel and St. Lawrence, to Quebec. At Quebec they were returned to their old prison, in which
they remained until June 1782, when they were brought from thence to Whitehall and there exchanged
for British prisoners. From their capture to their exchange was three years and eight months. Of the 240
prisoners taken in the neighborhood of Lake Champlain in November 1778, and carried to Canada in
the schooners Maria and Charleton, only 48 were known to have returned - many dying from ‘camp
fever’. The elder Ferris died in 1811 at the age of 92; and of the other 47, Squire Ferris, of Vergennes,
his son and fellow prisoner, is supposed to be the only survivor. Squire died at Vergennes March 17,
1849, age 87 years. Several of these prisoners received pensions from the general government, but
Squire Ferris, their companion in sufferings, though poor and needy, and though an applicant for many
years, never received the bounty of his country. Born to Peter and his wives (?) were:</div>
