            <div class="person-text">(1.2.3.4.2.4.3.2) GEORGE FREEMAN UNDERHILL (1844-1901) resided in Bolivia
and Cuba; married Jennie L {maiden name unk};
George F. Underhill was a citizen of the United States, who had constructed a waterworks system for the city of Bolivar, under a
contract with the government, and was engaged in supplying the place with water; and he also carried on a machiney repair
business. Some time after the entry of Gen. Hernandez, Underhill applied to him, as the officer in command, for a passport to
leave the city. Hernandez refused this request, and requests made by others in Underhill&#x27;s behalf, until October 18th, when a
passport was given, and Underhill left the country.
