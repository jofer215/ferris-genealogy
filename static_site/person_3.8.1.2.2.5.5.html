            <div class="person-text">(3.8.1.2.2.5.5) HENRY HARRISON FERRIS (Harrison H Ferris) born December 24, 1832
Ferrisburg, Addison, VT and died 1902 Princeton IL. Henry’s boyhood and youth were spent on the
farm at Ferrisburg and there he remained until twenty years of age, receiving a fair education in a select
school. Upon leaving his native state, he went to Upper Sandusky OH, where he remained one year,
and in the spring of 1854, went to Princeton. In Princeton, the first business he was engaged in was
buying and selling real estate, at which he was quite successful. He was still engaged in real estate
when the Civil War broke out and became a member of Company I., 12th Illinois Infantry Regiment,
commanded by his cousin Frank. He served ninety days and attempted to reenlist but was rejected on
account of his partially crippled hand. Returning home after being discharged, Henry resumed his real

estate business until 1864. In 1862, in partnership with his brother, Benjamin S., he purchased the
private bank of Carey, Olds and Company and under the name of B. S. Ferris &amp; Company, continued
the business. After a period of three successful years, the Honorable Justin S. Morrell of Vermont, an
old acquaintance, invested some money and the First National Bank of Princeton was organized and
duly incorporated. Because of health, Henry disposed of his bank stock, 1875 and went to Russell
County KS, where he invested in a flock of 10,000 sheep. For the next two years, he spent the greater
part of his life outdoors and his health improved; so he returned to Princeton, where he assisting in
organizing the Citizens’ National Bank and was elected Vice-President, until 1894, when he was
elected President. Served as Director of the grade schools in Princeton. He married, February 4, 1865
