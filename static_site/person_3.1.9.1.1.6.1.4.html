In the death of Reuben E. Glass, who spent the last years of his life retired from active life, in Broken Bow, Nebraska,
Custer county, lost one of its most valuable citzens [sic]. He had been a resident of the state since 1873 and during that time
he had become well known and had made many friends who appreciated his character and worth. Mr. Glass was born in
Detroit, Michigan, November 13, 1846, third of the six children born to Zenas and Sarah (Ferris) Glass, natives of New
York. The father, who was of Scotch-Irish descent, died in Michigan, and the mother survives, making her home in Lincoln,
Nebraska. Of their children: one son, Milton, died in the Civil war; one son, Edwin C., lives in Lincoln; one daughter, Mrs.
Sarah Frost, lives in Lincoln; others are deceased. Mr. Glass grew to manhood&#x27;s estate on a Michigan farm, receiving his
education in local schools. He served in the civil war as a member of Company D, Twenty-fourth Michigan Infantry, where
he won a creditable record, and after leaving the service returned to Michigan, where he engaged in business in the line of
retail drugs. His first wife was Mrs. Lina Ferguson, who died in Michigan, leaving one daughter, Mrs. Lizzie Nichols, who
has since died. In 1873, Mr. Glass came to Plattsmouth, Cass county, Nebraska, where he engaged in the drug business, and
there, on February 3, 1876, he married Miss Margaret Louise Mitchell, who was born in Iowa and came to Cass county in
1874. She is the daughter of Francis P. and Margaret (Wright) Mitchell, the former a native of Greene county, Ohio, and the
latter of South Carolina. The father, a physician by profession, died in New Orleans in the fifties, and the mother died in
Iowa in 1845. In 1878, Mr. and Mrs. Glass moved to Kearney, Nebraska, where they spent two years, but on account of
failing health he was obliged to give up his business, and in March, 1880, they came to Custer county and he took a
homestead of one hundred and sixty acres on South Loup where they remained ten years. He also pre-empted one hundred
and sixty acres of land, and in 1897 or 1898 purchased one hundred and sixty acres of land on section nineteen, township

seventeen range twenty, although he never lived on the latter place, which Mrs. Glass now owns. In December, 1891, Mr.
Glass retired from farm life and purchased a comfortable residence in Broken Bow, which continued his home until his
death, October 11, 1905. He was survived by his widow, who still lives in the home, where she has every comfort and is
surrounded by a large circle of sincere friends. Mr. Glass was a staunch Presbyterian in religious views and stood ready to
help any religious or beneficial movement in his county or state. He died in the prime of life, and his death came as a shock
to his many friends and acquaintances, by whom his loss was deeply deplored. He was regarded as a public-spirited citizen
and highly esteemed by all.
