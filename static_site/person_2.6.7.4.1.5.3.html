            <div class="person-text">(2.6.7.4.1.5.3) MOSES J. KNAPP born August 9, 1842 (Castleton) West Haven, Rutland, VT and died
September 10, 1934 Burlington, Old Soldier Home, VT; buried Dexter Cemetery, Jefferson Co NY;
was 5 feet 7 inches tall, with dark complexion, blue eyes and had dark (brown) hair; lived with his
parents until his enlistment at Fair Haven (Brattleboro) (Castleton) VT as a drummer in Company F,
14th Vermont Volunteer Infantry under Captain Joseph Jennings on (August 16) September 3, 1862.
His military records show him present for duty with the 14th Vermont, until he was shown as sick in
the Hospital at Baltimore in July, 1863. Moses served with that Regiment until he was mustered out
July 30, 1863. [Jim - The 14th Vermont Regiment was part of the 2d Vermont Brigade, commanded by
Brigadier General George Stannard and during the spring of 1863, the Vermonters protected the supply
lines between Washington as well as the Orange &amp; Alexandria Railroad from Bull Run to the
Rappahannock River, maintaining 20 miles of picket lines and 30 miles of railroads. On June 20, 1863,
Stannard was ordered to take his brigade and join the northward marching Army of the Potomac. Three

days later, with less than a month remaining in their term of service, the Vermonters were assigned to
the 3d Division of I Corps. Stannard’s footsore men covered 120 miles in just six days. When the
Battle of Gettysburg began on July 1, Stannard was ordered to rush his brigade to reinforce the
embattled I Corps, leaving behind the 12th and 15th Vermont to guard supply trains. The tree
remaining regiments of Stannard’s brigade arrived at Gettysburg in the evening, too late to see any
action that day. The brigade was posted on Cemetery Ridge, with the 16th Vermont deployed as
pickets. The next morning Stannard was placed in command of the infantry support for the Union
artillery batteries on the left of Cemetery Ridge. Stannard and his 2,200 men did little until late in the
day, when III Corps was driven from the peach orchard by repeated Confederate assaults. The
Vermonters were called upon to fill a major gap in the Union line and, with a determined charge,
helped re-establish the line. The 13th Vermont then handily drove back a regiment of Confederates,
saved the guns of the 5th U. S. Artillery and captured 80 Rebels. As night came, Stannard consolidated
his brigade’s position on Cemetery Ridge and again placed the 16th Vermont on the picket line. The
Vermonters, who had performed gallantly in their first major engagement, spent the night on the
battlefield. At 4 a.m., on July 3, the picket line of the 16th Vermont was probed by Confederate
infantry, and heavy skirmishing continued throughout the morning. Later, a brief exchange of artillery
inflicted a few casualties among the Vermonters, and enemy snipers took an interest in Stannard.
Bullets pierced his coat and took off a piece of his hat. At about 11 a.m., almost all firing stopped. The
Confederate attack on the Federal right had failed, and for two hours an uneasy lull settled over the
field. Then, at 1:07 p.m., two enemy guns fired, signaling the opening of the greatest artillery
bombardment of the war. For the next hour and 45 minutes, the Vermonters clung to the ground behind
their crude breastworks as Stannard paced up and down their lines. Shot and shell whizzed over their
ranks, but most of the rounds harmlessly overshot the Vermonters. The artillery then stopped, and on a
front almost a mile wide, 10,500 Confederate infantrymen advanced toward the center of the Union
line on Cemetery Ridge. In three lines of battle, with parade-ground order, the ensuing attack known as
Pickett’s Charge was an awesome sight. The skirmishers of the 16th Vermont fired a few shots, then
hastily fell back and re-formed behind the 13th Vermont. As the Confederates advanced farther toward
the Federal lines, their right wing appeared to be aimed at the 14th Vermont. But as the Vermonters rose
to fire, the Confederates changed direction and moved across the regiment’s front to close a gap that
had appeared in the line. The 14th Vermont opened fire at about 300 yards. The 13th Vermont soon
added its rifles to the fire. The Confederates advanced to within 20 yards of II Corps on Cemetery
Ridge. After exchanging a few volleys, they charged with a Rebel yell. Striking the Union center hard,
they charged and drove a Pennsylvania regiment from the soon-to-be famous ‘Angle’. The Rebels were
now concentrated to the right of the Vermonters’ position. Stannard saw the tremendous opportunity
presented by the situation. Despite the risk of exposing his brigade’s left flank, he launched a flanking
attack on the Confederates. Ordering the 13th Vermont to march right, closer to the point of the enemy
attack, he directed the men to ‘charge front forward on first company’. Swinging out at an oblique
angle to the Union line, the regiment opened fire at ‘half pistol range’ on the exposed flank of the
Confederates. As the 13th Vermont moved into position, Stannard ordered the 16th Vermont to join the
13th. After the 16th Vermont was in line next to the 13th, the two regiments advanced toward the
Confederates while continuing to pour deadly fire into the now-shattered butternut ranks. The
enfilading cross-fire ravaged the densely packed Rebels, driving them back and crowding them toward

their center. The fighting in front of the Vermonters ended. They had devastate the Confederate right,
inflicting heavy casualties and taking hundreds of prisoners as well as the colors of the 8th Virginia
Infantry. Two additional Confederate brigades, sent to support Major General George Pickett’s assault,
now belatedly advanced directly toward the 14th Vermont. Again the Vermonters promptly opened fire
as the Rebels came into range. Stannard, waving his sword and hat, promptly sent the 16th Vermont
and four companies of the 14th charging into the Rebels, capturing many additional prisoners as well as
the colors of the 2d Florida Infantry. The 2d Vermont Bridge performed as well as veteran troops at
Gettysburg, but not without loss. Of its nearly 2,400 men engaged, 342 were killed, wounded or
missing] Moses reenlisted, at Watertown NY, August 22, 1864, as a musician with Company B, 186th
Regiment New York Infantry Volunteers and served with that organization, as the Drum Major, at
Sacketts Harbor and near Alexandria VA, until he was mustered out June 2, 1865 at Alexandria VA.
He married, first, circa August, 1864, at Brownville, Jefferson County NY, Mary A. Plumb (18461878); second, February 24, 1879, Hannah Mary Cramond(Eramond?) born in 1848 at Wolfe Island,
Ontario, Canada and died December 15, 1893 at Chaumont NY; third, October 30, 1895, Frances J.
(McClellan) Jackson (1856-1924) - she divorced her husband in North Dakota. Moses spent most of his
later life in Dexter and Chaumont, where he was a painter and decorator; listed his occupation as a
mechanic on his pension papers. Moses purchased the Philip P. Gaige house in Chaumont in 1879 and
sold it in 1889; the house had been modernized and was still standing in 1995. He was a member of the
Presbyterian Church in Chaumont. Moses applied for a pension, based on his Civil War service, in
1907 and it took until 1913 before it was granted. Born to Moses and Mary were:</div>
