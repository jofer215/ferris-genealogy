            <div class="person-text">(3.1.2.1.11.5.4) POLLY FERRIS born May 24, 1826 Roxbury (Moresville?), Delaware, NY and died
August 11, 1853 Moresville NY; buried Old Cemetery near Methodist Church, Grand Gorge; married
1848 Wilson Page More [son of John and Anna (Gould) More][brother to Taylor, above] born May 3,
1825 More Settlement, on the farm adjoining his grandfather&#x27;s; when he was 9 years of age, his father
purchased the hotel at Moresville, and removed to that village, where Wilson grew to manhood; a
vigorous, thoughtful and studious boy and young man, and improved the educational advantages of the
village school and of the Delhi Academy, which secured him a good English education; 1848 he
purchased the hotel and adjoining farm of 200 acres of his father, where he began in earnest the battle
of life, but he was severely handicapped from the very start. He assumed so great an indebtedness in
the purchase of the property, that the interest on it became a burden greater than the business was able
to bear; so, after persevering five years, he sold the hotel to Mr. Samuel Jenkins in 1853, thus this
public house, which had been the property of four generations, during a period of 67 years, passed from
the possession of the family. Mr. More grew to manhood in the hotel, and never acquired a taste for
either tobacco or liquor, but all his life was a staunch, practical, aggressive temperance man. After the
sale of the hotel, he devoted all his energies to agricultural pursuits. He erected a comfortable residence
on the farm, with substantial dairy buildings, and he was considered one of the best farmers in the
region. In August of the year that he removed to the farm, the shadow of affliction fell across his home,
and his beloved wife passed forever from these earthly scenes, leaving an infant son; remarried 1859
and there were kids born to that union also; and born to Polly and Wilson were:</div>
