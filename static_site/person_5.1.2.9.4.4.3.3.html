Obituary, Highland Democrat, Peekskill, NY, Saturday, June 17, 1916: Miss Mary Elizabeth Tompkins
died at the Peekskill Hospital on Sunday afternoon, after an illness of several months. On May 23 she
was taken to the hospital and operated on, but owing to the nature of her illness, she could only be
made comfortable. Everything that medical skill and loving attention could bestow was given to her,
but without avail. She bore her sufferings without a murmur. Miss Tompkins born in Peekskill Hollow
fifty years ago, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Sands Tompkins. When about two years of age her parents
moved to Lake Oscawana, and Libbie, as she was familiarly called by her family and friends, spent her
entire life there. She was of a quiet unassuming disposition. Those who knew her well and could count
her a friend knew her real worth. For many years her father and mother conducted a summer boarding
house at the lake, and at their death Miss Tompkins was left with the house and its responsibilities.
With the help of Durl Spock, who for fourteen years has been her faithful business agent and adviser,
she made &quot;Rocky Rest&quot; known far and wide for its real home comforts for summer residents, and its
rooms were always engaged long before the season opened. The interment was in the family plot at
Hillside. Miss Tompkins was the last of her family, father and mother, two brothers and a sister having
died some years ago. The nearest living relative is a nephew, Zacariah Tompkins, who resides in
Peekskill.</div>
