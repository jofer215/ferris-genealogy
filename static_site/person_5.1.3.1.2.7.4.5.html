            <div class="person-text">(5.1.3.1.2.7.4.5) ELLEN FERRIS born September 4, 1867 Carthage, Hancock, IL and died March 24,
1938 Cleveland OH; buried in Carthage; married June 27, 1889 in Carthage, Ralph Eugene Scofield
born November 5, 1866 Carthage IL and died October 8, 1950 Kansas City MO;
One of the younger, but also one of the prominent, members of the bar of Kansas City, became connected with the
profession here in 1888, and almost from the beginning has occupied a foremost place in legal ranks. He is rich in the
special qualities that insure success, qualities that money cannot command and that influence cannot gain, but that labor and
energy may largely acquire. Endowed by nature with a well-balanced mind, he has added to this a thorough and scholarly
knowledge, enterprise and resolute purpose, and is undoubtedly destined to achieve still further successes in his chosen
calling. Mr. Scofield was born in Carthage, Illinois, November 5, 1866, and is a son of Bryant T. and Sarah (Collins)
Scofield, natives of New York. The father was a lawyer of high prominence in Carthage, having for many years the largest
practice in Hancock county. He removed to that place at an early day and practiced there until his death, which occurred in
1881, when he had reached the age of 57 years. He served as a member of the Illinois senate and was one of the leading
citizens of his locality. His widow is now living in Fairfield, Iowa, a member of the Episcopal church. In their family were 6
children, 5 of whom are now living, namely: Glenn W.; Hattie, wife of Rev. J. M. Cromer; Julia, wife of J. S. McKemy;
Edward B. and Ralph E. The last named spent his boyhood days in his native city, and completed his literary course by his
graduation at Carthage College in 1885. He entered this college at the age of 12 years, after going through the public school
course. While in college he decided to study law, and during vacation and in his leisure times he studied law in the office of
Harvey Schofield, and was admitted to the bar on examination before the supreme court of Illinois. He then began practice
in Carthage, but in a few months came to Kansas City, where he has since made his home. On the 27th of June, 1889, he
was united in marriage with Miss Ellen Ferris, daughter of Hiram G. and Julia E. (Holden) Ferris. They now have 2 children
- Miriam and Harriet. The parents are members of the First English Lutheran church, and at 1010 Belfontaine Avenue they
have a pleasant home. In his social relations, Mr. Scofield is a Mason, and in his political views is a democrat. He comes of
a family of lawyers. His father, as before stated, was a prominent legal practitioner, and several other representatives of the
name have attained eminence in the calling. He is also a cousin of Judge Charles J. Scofield, of Carthage, a celebrated
lawyer, also a minister of high degree in the Christian church. Few men have as spotless a reputation, and he was at one
time the youngest circuit judge in the United States. A characteristic of the family is uprightness in all dealings, and early
learnng such lessons in youth Mr. Scofield, of this review, has modeled his own life after those teachings. He has excellent
ability as a lawyer, and his genial disposition and affable manners have won for him the confidence, friendship and high
esteem of a large acquaintance.
