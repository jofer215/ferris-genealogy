            <div class="person-text">(2.5.2.4.7.5.5) JAMES HENRY HAIT (Hoyt) (Photograph) born (July) April 14, 1809 at Stamford and
died there December 14, 1873; buried Woodland Cemetery. James’ father was a farmer, and his early
educational advantages were those of the sons of our ordinary New England farmers. At the age of
seventeen he apprenticed to the cabinet-making business, and at the close of his minority he took the
business of his former master into his hands. He soon connected with this business the lumber trade. It

will illustrate his enterprise thus early in his business life, that while engaged in this trade he imported
the first cargo of hard coal ever brought to Stamford. In 1831, the canal extending from the harbor up
into the center of the village was opened. Mr. Hoyt united his business with the drygoods and grocery
trade of his two brothers, William and Roswell. Leasing the canal for five years, they purchased
shipping and did their own carrying trade, and imported their own West India goods. In this business
he contained with varied success until the expiration of their lease, when he resumed the lumber trade,
in which he continued until the New York and New Haven Railway was projected. In the building of
this great thoroughfare, he entered into contracts for grading portions of it, building bridges, and
furnishing ties. All of these contracts were promptly and acceptably executed. On the completion of
the road, at first built with a single track, he contracted to supply it with fuel, and when the second
track was laid, he was a heavy contractor for the work. From this statement it will be seen that Mr.
Hoyt, from the very beginning of this great public work until it had fairly established itself as an
efficiently-managed enterprise, had been connected with it in such ways as to make him familiar with
its character and wants. He had enjoyed a good opportunity of watching the management of the road
itself under its chief engineer and first superintendent, Mr. R.B. Mason, subsequently connected with
the Illinois Central Railway; and also under its second superintendent, George W. Whistler, Jr. That he
had not neglected the opportunity thus furnished him is evidenced in the unanimity of the choice,
which called him to the superintendency of the road on the resignation of Mr. Whistler in 1854. {More
info on the guy in History of Stamford, by E.B. Huntington.} He married 1st, January 31, 1838 in
Stamford, as her 2d husband, Sarah Jeanette (Gorham) Grey [dau of Samuel &amp; Abigail (Jones)
Gorham], born March 14, 1805 Darien and died March 20, 1865 Stamford; buried Woodland
Cemetery; married 2d January 12, 1869 in Stamford, Elizabeth C. Kilburn born c1813; born to him and
Sarah were:</div>
