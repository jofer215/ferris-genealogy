            <div class="person-text">(3.1.2.1.4.6.1.1.1) MARY MARTHA JOHNSTON (Minnie) born September 4, 1856 (4 years before
parents married?) (cemetery records agree with these dates), Bells Mills, Reynoldsville, Jefferson, PA
and died June 9, 1914 Loch Haven, Clinton Co PA; buried Winslow Hill, Benezette, Elk, PA; married
January 1, 1875 in Jefferson Co PA, William Keene Winslow [son of Charles Keene &amp; Rebecca (Hicks)
Winslow] born August 16/20, 1846 Winslow Farm, Benezette, Elk Co PA and died August 3, 1913

Philadelphia PA; buried Winslow Hill, Benezette PA. William bought the farm he born on in 1875. He
helped his father convert the forest into farm land. He received his education in the common schools of
Benezette. He stepped backward into a stairwell on the barn floor and fell to the basement. He was
paralyzed and the doctor felt that his neck and spine were fractured. He was taken to the University
Hospital in Philadelphia where he died. From the Renova Daily Record: Winslow was taken to the
hospital on Saturday in a special train after he had fallen down stairs at home. The run between
Driftwood and that city was made in record time, the train having been given the right of way. The
special was met at Thirty Second and Market Streets by an ambulance from the hospital. An operation
was performed immediately but proved of no avail. They were members of the Church of the Messiah.
His wife Mary died within the year from cancer. She never knew that her husband had died because of
her health. Obit: “Editor Joseph A Johnston of the Driftwood Gazette is mourning the recent death of
both his mother and sister. The mother, Mrs. Eliza M Johnston, passed away Monday morning June
8th at DuBois age 80y 3m. His sister, Mrs. W. K. Winslow died in a Loch Haven Hospital following a
fourth operation performed 4 weeks ago. She was age 57y and leaves a family of six children, four sons
and 2 daughters all grown to manhood and womanhood, and we extend Brother Johnston our sincere
sympathy in his sore bereavement.” Born to them were:</div>
