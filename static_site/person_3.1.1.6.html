            <div class="person-text">(3.1.1.6) ISAAC FERRIS (AFN: 8RLL-SB) born 1735 Stanwich CT and died in July 11, 1819 at age
84, Columbia, Hamilton, OH; by tradition, he and his son, Ebenezer, served in the Revolutionary War,
under Washington in the Battle of White Plains, but his name is not found on any payroll. He was
purported to have been taken prisoner while defending his house against a British raid and was later
exchanged as a prisoner of war. His taxes were waived twice, because of losses sustained in those raids;
because of the destruction on his home and property, departed New York. Isaac, with his family, and
nephew John Ferris and his family, left Stanwich in December 1788, and after stopping in New Jersey
to visit relatives, they went by wagon as far as Pittsburg, and thence by flat-boat down the Ohio River,
arriving at Fort Miami (Columbia, Hamilton County) OH, December 12, 1789. The party was under
command of Captain Benjamin Stites. [Jim - as another source puts it: On September 20, 1789, with his
family, and accompanied by two other families, they took their departure from Stanwich. As the little
party of emigrants took their seats in wagons and moved down the road, they were surrounded by a
crowd on every side ready to predict that they would fall a sacrifice to savage cruelty or be drowned in
descending the Western rivers. But nothing could overcome the courage of the little company. Their
route was along the road on the north side of Long Island Sound to New York City, thence through
New Jersey and Pennsylvania and over the Allegheny Mountains to the Monongahel River; thence, by
boats to Fort Miami; about three-fourths of a mile below the mouth of Little Miami, where they arrived

December 12, 1789, having been two months and twenty days on the journey. AAfter making fast the
boats, ascended the steep bank and cleared away the underbrush in the midst of a pawpaw thicket,
when the women and children sat down. They next placed sentinels at a small distance from the thicket,
and having first united in song of praise to Almighty God, upon their knees they offered thanks for the
past, and prayer for future protection. Blockhouses were erected as promptly as possible, for the
storage of goods, and the protection of the women and children, and thus began the settlement of
Columbia, the nucleus of a great city. There were, at that time, some thirty of forty families living in the
fort, without the restraints of civil law and destitute of almost all kinds of provisions except such as
could be obtained from the woods, in which hovered the hostile savages. An apartment in the fort,
about sixteen feet square, was assigned to the family, in which they resided for a time.] These Ferris’
were all charter members of the Columbia Baptist Church organized there in March 1790, the first
Baptist church in the Northwest Territory, north and west from the Ohio River to the Pacific Ocean. Of
the nine constituent members, three bore the name Ferris and Isaac was made deacon. For several
years, these pioneers lived on wild game and crops planted on the flood plain of the Little Miami River.
The forest to the north was a dangerous refuge for hostile Indians, a hazard that was not eliminated
until General Anthony Wayne’s victory at the battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794. Some years later, he
moved to Duck Creek vicinity [northwest of Columbia] and purchased 200 acres from John Cleves
Symmes. They sold land to a Joseph Clark, 1802. He died here and is buried beside his wife in the
Duck Creek Baptist Church burying ground (Note: By 1900, the site had been abandoned, the church
no longer existed and the cemetery was devasted. The church relocated and became the Hyde Park
Baptist Church, without a cemetery on the grounds. The area were the original church and cemetery
was located was cleared for commercial development; I-71 now courses through the grounds; several
graves were moved to other unk locations. Isaac married c1765 Mary Sherwood (AFN: 8RLM-C7)
born April 24, 1742/46, Greenwich and died 1825 Columbia OH [dau of Jabez and Hanna (Disbrow)
Sherwood]. See Photograph of Isaac Ferris home. Born to them were:</div>
