            <div class="person-text">(5.1.1.5.3.2.1.1.4.2) WILLIAM MEAD LINDSLEY FISKE III (Photo) born June 4, 1911 Brooklyn NY
and died August 18 (17), 1940 Chichester, England; married 1938 at Maidenhead, England, Rose
Bingham. There is loads of information on the Internet on Billy Fiske. Born into a wealthy family,
Fiske was at school in Europe in 1928 when he and a few other Americans formed a bobsled team to
enter the Winter Olympics at St. Mortiz, Switzerland. The fearless seventeen-year-old Fiske was
chosent to drive the 5-man bobsled and he drove it to a gold medal. Four years later, he won another
gold medal as driver of the winning 4-man sled in the Lake Placid Olympics. Fiske also won the Grand
National championship on the famed Cresta Run in Switzerland in 1936 and 1938. Fiske married the
Countess of Warwick in 1938 and he joined the British Royal Air Force in 1939 shortly after WWII
began. He was seriously wounded on a mission over Europe in June of 1940. He landed his plan in
England but died a short time later. The Billy Fiske Memorial Trophy is awared to the national
champion 4-man bobsled team. From the London Daily Mail, July 6, 2001: Someone had walked
mysteriously down to that shadowy old corner of the cemetery again and put more flowers on Billy
Fiske’s grave. The grave was squeezed in under drooping trees. And the sun hardly ever got through to
light it up. ‘Pilot Officer W.M.L. Fiske III’ was on the headstone. Then, ‘Born 4 June 1911 in Chicago.
Killed in Action 17 August 1940. He died for England.’ What that tells you about Billy Fiske is
nothing, because he was the all-time golden boy, and now there is something in the cinemas and his
name is starting to be heard. The film is Pearl Harbor and it has a handsome American pilot leaving for
England to join the RAF’s famous all-American Eagle Squadron. Then he fought in the Battle of
Britain, which is about where the real Fiske comes in. In the 21 Club in New York, after a hard day
making another fortune in banking, a friend said the news from London was grim. War seemed certain.
Britain was going to need fighter pilots. Billy’s eyes shone like the silver dollars he tossed to the
shoeshine boys on Wall Street. A war was a different kind of thrill. His life had been full of thrills, such
as waiting at the top of Cresta Run in St Moritz ready to be called for his two minutes of terror
rocketing down the ice. He was the best there was for a while. Won an Olympic bobsled gold medal for
the United States in 1928 when he was only 16. Another in ’32. There wasn’t a society place in Europe
where Billy wouldn’t stop the traffic in the lobby when he checked into the hotel and you should have
seen the crowd around him in Monte Carlo, watching his hand hover over the roulette table, clicking a
tube of $100 chips. First time anyone heard of him here was when stories came down from Cambridge,
where he studied the late Twenties. The stories were of him getting up to 110mph between Trinity Hall
and Mlldenhall golf club in his 4 litre green Bentley. Money meant nothing. Billy Fiske did it all. The
beauties of Europe’s high society clung to him like ivy. Now the richest cigar smoke in the world held
like low cloud in the 21 Club the night that Billy heard about the big fight coming in the sky over
Britain. It was something he had to be part of; the biggest thrill of all. No American came with more
blue-blood. His father was head of Dillon, Reade, and Co., close to being America’s biggest investment
banker. But being American was no good for joining the RAF. You had to be British, though
Commonwealth or Empire would do. Anyway Billy got a suite on the Arcadia and sailed for England.
That was August 1939. The woman he had met at St. Moritz ball, Rose Bingham, former Countess of
Warwick, was his wife now and could open some doors. Billy’s fame took care of the rest. Just how he
persuaded Air Chief Marshall Sir William Elliott to take him, no one knows, but when he left the Savoy

soon after their meeting in September 1939, Billy was going to be in the war. In his diary he put: ‘I had
a quiet Saturday night before the selection board appointment because I didn’t want to have eyes
looking like blood stained oysters.’ ‘A natural pilot,’ his instructor said. He qualified and was posted to
Tangmere in Sussex. The base was to be burned into the history of the Battle of Britain. The 601
Squadron was there. The Millionaire’s Squadron, it was called. Most of the pilots had parachuted out of
the pages of Debrett’s. Max Aitken, son of Daily Express owner Lord Beaverbrook was in 601, and Sir
Philip Sassoon, Loel Guinness, William Rhodes-Moorhouse, one of the Montagu bank family. Now
Billy Fiske was around, looking for excitement. Just so petrol rationing wouldn’t spoil running their
wonderful cars, Willie Rhodes-Moorhouse was told to fix it. He did: he bought the local garage. Only
the tanks were nearly empty. Loel Guinness as a director of Shell and got the company to send a tanker
to top them up. This is how these guys lived between bravery in combat. Billy was right in there with
them. Billy flew his Hurricane to glory. Ed Murrow, the American radio reported, credited him with six
kills. He was a sensation. The day he ran out of bullets, he manoeuvred a JU88 bomber into a barrage
balloon. American pilots, civilians, were arriving in Britain and the Eagle Squadron was forming. Billy
got word he would be sent to lead it when they were ready. The morning started full of sun over
Tangmere on August 16, 1940. There was a scramble at 12.25. Billy flew into a dark sheet of Stuka
dive-bombers moving on the base. He engaged them. A good shot form a German tail gunner hit his
engine. The Hurricane caught fire. It came smoking over a hedge and belly-flopped back on the
Tangmere runway. His lower body and hands were burned. That night he was sitting up joking in bed at
the Royal West Sussex Hospital in Chichester. Next day he was dead. Died of shock,’ his commander,
Sir Archibald Hope, said in his grief. A Union Jack and the Stars and Stripes were over his coffin when
they carried him through the trees of Boxgrove Priory. He was 29 and the first American in uniform to
die in Europe in WWII, which seems like a really big movie waiting to be made. On July 4, 1941, a
plaque was unveiled to his memory in St. Paul’s Cathedral. Under his name are the words: “An
American citizen who died that England might live.”</div>
