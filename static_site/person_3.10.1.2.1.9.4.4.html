OBITUARY: Cortland Democrat, March 23, 1916 DEATH OF NATHAN P. DARBY
&quot;Word has been received here by relatives of Nathan P. Darby, announcing his death which occurred at
his home in Moravia Wednesday morning, at the age of 79 years, death resulting from a shock of
paralysis which he sustained on Thursday, the 16th. He is survived by his wife and a number of nieces
and nephews and was a cousin of the late Mrs. Harriet Chollar of this village. Mr. Darby spent the
greater part of his life near McLean, where he was a prosperous farmer. He had lived in Moravia for 29
years. Private funeral services will be held at the family home in Moravia Friday morning. The body
will be brought here for internment in McLean Old Baptist Church Cemetery.&quot;
From the &quot;History of McLean Baptist Church&quot;: “It has been felt that this history should not be closed
without a word of appreciation for those who helped to make the worship of the house of God a
pleasant Service by the use of instrumental music. As far back as 1854 &amp; 1855 Mr. &amp; Mrs. James
Mineah brought their small melodeon in a democrat wagon, if the day was fine, and it was carried
upstairs to the singers seats, their daughter Susanna playing for the service. After the services of the day
were over, it was taken home again at night. This continued for about two years, then Deacon Amos
Hart, Susanna&#x27;s grandfather, presented a $70.00 melodeon to the church. Miss Susanna Mineah played
it until her marriage and was a very regular attendant. She was succeeded by her sister, Martha Mineah,

who afterwards was Mrs. Nathan Darby. She played until the time of her death. She was greatly
missed. The church felt as if she could not be spared. Sarah Ronk took her place as organist and played
as long as her health permitted. These two were beautiful Christian characters, faithful unto death!”</div>
