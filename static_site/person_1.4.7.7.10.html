            <div class="person-text">(1.4.7.7.10) ELIZABETH (ELIZA) SEAMAN (Photo) born May 9, 1815 NYC and died
February 9, 1900 in Drayton Plains, Oakland, MI; married November 23, 1836 at 89
Madison Street, NYC in a Quaker ceremony, Augustus Wright Leggett “Gussie” [son of
William Haight &amp; Margaret Peck (Wright) Leggett] born June 11, 1816 NYC and died
January 12, 1885, Detroit, Wayne, MI. OBITUARY - Mrs. Elizabeth Seaman Leggett Widely-Known Friend of the People died yesterday. Patriotic Woman accomplished
much for humanity. Interesting Story of Her Long and Busy Career. Mrs. Eliza Seaman
Leggett, widow of the late Augustus W. Leggett, died at the home of her daughter, Mrs.
C. C. Randall, of Drayton Plains, at ten minutes after 7 yesterday morning. Her seven
children and many of her grandchildren were with her at the end. In the death of Eliza
Seaman Leggett friendship loses one of the most faithful exponents, peace one of its
most insistent advocates and kindness one of its most shining examples. She had the
faculty of gaining the admiration and love of everyone with whom she came in contact,
and in her eighty-five years of life she endeared herself to hundreds of people by gentle
acts of charity and loving-kindness. Always active and energetic, her every thought was
for the promotion of the good and the happiness of others, her every act for the benefit
of sone fellow being.
Eliza Seaman Leggett was born in New York May 9, 1815. Her father was Dr.
Valentine Seaman, a prominent physician, the first to introduce vaccination into the state
of New York. On November 23, 1836, she married Augustus W. Leggett and moved
with him to Roslyn, L.I., a village to which she gave its name. There was made the
acquaintance of William Cullen Bryant and Charles A. Dana and she knew many
interesting anecdotes of the professional side of those two men. After twent- two years
in Roslyn, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Leggett removed to Michigan and settling in Pontiac. They
afterwards moved to Mill Farm, Clintonville and remained there until they came to
Detroin in 1864.
Center of Literary Activity. The Leggett home on East Elizabeth Street early became
a center of social and literary activity. Mrs. Leggett was the founder of the Detroit

Woman&#x27;s Club. She had made a practice of entertaining Madame King and Mrs. L. H.
Stone at her home one afternoon every week, the club grew out of those gatherings and
the preliminary meetings were held in the basement of the old Unitarian church. Mrs.
Cheaney, of Boston, was also prominent in the work of the orgainzation and Mrs. John J.
Bagley was the clubs first president. The &quot;Aurora Boraslis&quot; was the work of Mrs.
Leggett and the first meeting of the Prismatic Club was held at her home. Mr. Leggett
was this clubs first president. It was Mrs. Leggett who was one of the first to advocate
taking Belle Isle for a public park, and the idea of having public drinking fountains
originated with her. The plan of setting aside a day dedicated to the memory of
Columbus came from Mrs. Leggett and was suggested by her to the poet Walt Whitman
whomshe knew intimately well. The Custer School owes its first flag to her generosity,
and she was among the first to advocate the flying of the national colors from the staff of
every schoolhouse in the country.
The slavery question interested Mrs. Leggett deeply and she was an ardent and
outspoken Abolitionist. She was closely in touch with the Underground Railroad and
helped many a poor creature to escape into Canada. During the time of the war she was
in close correspondence with Garrett Smith and other men prominent in anti slavery
matters. She knew Laura Haviland intimately and was of great service to her in her
work. Her lovable nature gave her a strong hand on many poor creatures, whom no one
else could move to repent since she never shrank from any person, no matter how vile.
On one occasion a woman who was known as a thoroughly desperate character called at
the home and insisted on meeting Mrs. Leggett, after she had refused to yeild to the
words of any other human being but Mrs. Leggett drew from her whole story and
afterwards aided her to reform.
--- Earnest Worker--- In the work leading up to and connected with the Freedman&#x27;s
Fair. Mrs. Leggett played a prominent part, she was a delegate to the fair at Chicago,
and appeared there in the character of Mrs. Partington in her work against slavery and in
the work she was doing for literature. Mrs. Leggett knew some of the most prominent
reformers and literaries or her time. Among them were Theodore Parker, Lucretiaa
Mott, Washington Irving, Alcott with many others. One of the best instances of her farreaching interest in the work of reform and aid was the fact that she opened her house
for a fair for the benefit of the Working Woman&#x27;s Home. The fair lasted three days and
such was the prestige given to it from its place of meeting and such was Mrs. Leggett&#x27;s
influence on those surrounding her that she turned over to the treasurer of the home over
$ 1,300.

Mrs. Leggett resided in Detroit until the death of her husband in 1885. In that year
she went to Drayton Plains and took up her residence with her son, Mortimer A.
Leggett. Her failing health two years ago necessitated her removal to the residence of
her daughter, Mrs. C. C. Randall, whose home she lived until the last summon came.

Dear Children, - I have written so often regarding the disposal of bits of furniture and
things. And in looking them over I have destroyed a great deal, thinking it best to do so.
I hope and do believe you will all do just right. So I leave what I have not designated to
your good judgement. To Willie, I have given so much already that you must count that
for him, I mean bits. The plated stuff, the urn to John, the looking glass, many, etc., The
old English poets, three volumes, are for Guss W. Ives. The Bryant books and bits you
mustdivide pleasantly. This old round table for Mort. The pretty china vases I gave to
Eliza L. Randal long ago-the shells that are about came from Grandma Margaret
Leggett. Divide them as you think best. Make sure each grandchild has a bit. You know
how I want the silver divided - weigh all there is except the gift of cups to Lizzy and
Blanche. Let every scrap be put together and weighed and equally divided. I think you
all know how feel about everything. Mylittle writing desk for Elizabeth Barthel.
Elizabeth Seaman Leggett, Drayton Plains,Michigan 11/10/1888
My dear Mort., I give you my father&#x27;s watch, the one that he always wore and after
he died my mother wore the one my brother, John F. Seaman sent to me. I&#x27;ve intended it
for Valentine T. Ives, he seemed to think he&#x27;d be my doctor but he will probably have the
picture of Valentine Seaman, M.D., that will due. Also I say in this for Anna T. Randall,
the largest looking glass as I feel it best that she should have it. By some way, Willie
should should have the other glass.- I feel happier for Annie to have this. Mortimer
should also have the old bookcase. Lamb&#x27;s History of New York the very old book L.
Seaman sent to me. The Universal Histories of the magazine from Lee Seaman, the, the
Leggett Family Bible, the one of W. H. Leggetts grandfather Anna Randall to have my
mother&#x27;s bible. The handsome Shakespeares to Augusta W. Pease the choice of the
eminent women as Lizzy had the beautiful photo book. I&#x27;ve given many books to
William. I own and also to Elizabeth. The great encyclopedia to Blanche. I gave them
to her when she was sixteen. Make the division of books as little trouble as you can and
also other bits of appreciation. You must manage as you can. You must not say mother
said I could have this or that but do exactly right. The old green and the old round table
for Anna Randall. Many bits you must settle among yourselves. I have made lissts and
torn them up. The Henry chair, the old clock , the marble slab, my Mother&#x27;s bureau, the

handsome library table, my pictures, my mother&#x27;s picture, father&#x27;s, Percy&#x27;s picture crayon
oh, and lots that I have not given Now Do exactly right. The lounge, bedstead I want
Mort to have the bedstead and all that appertanins to it. The small bedstead in the room
I now occupy for Blanche in lieu of the mattress she gave me and I think the pillows.
This is my last will and testament. Eliza S. Leggett Nov. 10, 1888
Detroit, Oct. 12th., 1887 This is my last will an testement, I give &amp; bequeath to my
children: Mortimer, William, Margaret, Anna, Elizabeth, Augusta and Blanche, all my
property real and personal - all of which I may die possessed to them, and to their heirs
and assigns forever to be equally divided between them and it is my will that should any
of my said children die before this will becomes operative, leaving issue that such child&#x27;s
share go to such issue. The special disposition of certain parts of my personal property
such as pieces of furniture and the like is suggested in a letter, which I leave with this
my will: the provisions in which will I trust, be followed by my children, since the said
gifts are in nature of special bequeaths, and expresses my wishes therein. It is my wish
that all sums of money that may be due me from any of my children at the time of my
death, be deducted from their share of my said estate, but that interest due and unpaid at
the such time be considered as cancelled and be not deducted. The share of my said
estate here given to my son William, is subject to advances heretofore made to him, and
amounting in all, to $ 1,150, I wish that all interests on this sum that is not paid at my
death, be not charged against him, but that the principal sum only, be deducted. This
sum he having already had his portion of my estate, will be lessen to that extent.
Should I leave any real esstate, I impower my executors to sell the same, at either
public or private sale, as they may deem best, in the interest of all. It is my wish that my
funeral be as inexpensive and unostentatious as possible, and that no badges or
indications of mourning be worn after my death in commeration of me.
I appoint D. J. Davidson and Lewis T. Ives as executors of my will in testimony
thereof I have hereunto set my hand and seal this twelfth day of October, 1887.
Elizabeth Seaman Leggett The above instrument was, at the request of the testator, and
in her presence, and in the presence of each of us, signed by us as attesting witnesses
thereto, and declared by the said testator to be her last will and testament. Harry J. Hartz
and Fred W. Baker [Proved - 25 March 1901]
Eliza writes of her mother - &quot;... my Mother. She was considered very beautiful as a
girl and never lost her beauty as a woman - exquisite complexion, soft dark hair, bright
dark hair. She born at Grove Farm, Quaker parents. When it grew to be time for the
daughter to have a little better opportunity than a country school would give, the parents
proposed to have her go to New York. As Grandfather John was leaving, the bright little

grandmother said, &quot;Now, John, have a care in selecting a boarding-place for our Anne,
don&#x27;t let her have a home where there are young men, for thee knows my dear, she is too
pretty, and the young men could not fail to be enticed.&quot; Be sure John to remember.&quot; No
place except among friends or Quakers could be thought of and making all due enquiry,
grandfather John made arrangements for the beautiful Anne to stay at Willet Seaman&#x27;s.
Now at this same Willet Seaman&#x27;s there were six boys if not more, four daughters; but
notwithstanding the agreement was made. Ah! Grandfather John! When the next day
the wise little grandmother met her husband at the gate, and found out the state of the
case, &quot;Ah John she said, &quot; but did I not warn thee, there are many sons there.&quot; &quot;Yes.
My-Anna, but if thee could see them thee would have no fear for Anne, a homelier set of
boys thee never saw. Trust me, she never could take one. I saw them at dinner. Oh MyAnne, they were ordinary in the extreme.&quot; So the little beauty went to be taught
accomplishments to make pincushions with flowers on them and most elaborate needleboo grew into a &quot;sweet&quot; think under the dainty hands, such hands as my mother had,
they had never been allowed to use a broom or lift a weight so delicate our grandmothers
guarded well the complexions and forms of their daughters - no firelight must shine
upon their face &quot;take a screen my dear - Elijah don&#x27;t let thy sister lift that side of the
table it will spoil the shape of her hand - don&#x27;t go out in the air without covering thy face
dear, much weather hurts thy face.&quot; In March if there was snow on the ground our
grandmother gathered demijohns of the medicated snow. So much (?) they said; enough
would be done to last for the toilet until the next March - dear old grandma&#x27;s. &quot;Well
mother&quot; I said one evening as I sat at her feet on a little bench, &quot;Why did thee fall in
love with such a homely man, for thee think so much of beauty?&quot; She patted me on the
face and said, &quot;Why my dear thy father was not such a very homely man, he had a nice
shape to his face, short black silky hair, very pretty eyes, his mouth was not a bad
mouth, neither was his nose a bad nose, oh no my dear, your father was not a bad
looking man.&quot; Blessed mother, if thy could have heard the tone of her voice and seen
the look in her face, as the bright light of the fire softened all, in that &quot;little while before
ten,&quot; the, &quot;oh no my dear thy father was not a bad looking man,&quot; another time I said,
&quot;Mother I wish I was handsome as my sister Marianna and Anne are, they are called so
beautiful, nobody calls me even pretty and I would like to be pretty.&quot; Then she looked at
me awhile, always our little talks were before the lamps were lighted and before my
brothers came home to tea as we sat by the fire, She took my chin in her hand and said,
&quot;why Eliza thee has a pretty good nose - if it had been a little larger, it would not have
been a bad nose.&quot; Then she would pull it down a little. &quot;Thy eyes are good enough, if
they were not set a little to far back, thy hair is nice enough, so too thy forehead is pretty

fair, and if thee will try to keep thy mouth from drooping in the corners and always try to
have a smile on thy face, thee would look very well.&quot; Oh, dear, then she added, &quot;thee
looks very much like thy father my dear.&quot; Well, that satisfied me, for all thro my life
until this moment my father was my idol so I said, &quot;That will make me happy, I wish I
could know how he looked.&quot; &quot;Very much like thy brother Willet.&quot; Now my brother
Willet was not a bit good looking but I loved him dearly, and the elder brothers snubbed
him, sot hat made me love him more dearly, so I had to accept the &quot;not bad looking
face,&quot; but I used to go to the glass and try to pinch my cheeks so as to get dimples to
come, and when we went to parties and I went very young I would pinch my checks - oh
dear again.
Well, the pretty Anna still lived at Friend Willet Seaman&#x27;s, and worked at the lovely
satin needle book and it grew so pretty, it was a dove color satin on the outside and lined
with pink satin for Quakers loved color and where they dare-would put it in. There was
a place for scissors, and bodkin. Oh, lots of little tiny pockets for all useful things and
space for saving silk in skeens - and the young Valentine delighted to watch Anna&#x27;s
pretty fingers bring out the rose buds and forget me nots and trim it all with silver cord.
It took the greater part of the winter evening after the lessons were learned - and always
there were the admiring eyes, and heart too, to watch the progress, then it was finished,
&quot;Let me,&quot; said the young lover (yes I guess he was just that), &quot;let me take it in my room
a few days. I like to look at it.&quot; I wonder if the pretty Anna blushed, my mother did
blush so prettily, and if they pretty girl blushed, I wonder if it put the young Valentine&#x27;s
bones out of joint - I guess so. In a few days came back the case all filled with the best
sort of cutlery, scissors - two or three, one for cutting button holes - I remember one with
gilded bows. Oh dear, I guess somebody, two somebody&#x27;s, sort of fall in love and
nobody knows how but themselves (what&#x27;s the matter!!)&quot;
Recalling the death of her mother, Eliza wrote - &quot;Anna Seaman, my beloved mother,
died at Newburgh on the Hudson, she was living with my brother Valentine, who was
absent with his wife at Grove Farm. She was 84 and in her usual health. In the morning
my brother Percy came in to her room. She was sitting up in bed. She said, &quot;Percy, give
me a little brandy, I feel weak.&quot; He got it immediately, but she waved her hand and said,
&quot;I don&#x27;t need it,&quot; and died in a moment.
