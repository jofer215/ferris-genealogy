The home of Daniel Moore was the scene of a brilliant and happy wedding on Wednesday evening of last week when his
daughter, Lodica, was united in marriage to Wm. A. Mourer, in the presence of about 60 relatives and friends. The
ceremony was performed by Rev. George M. Brewin of Grand Rapids, using the Episcopal service and the impressive ring
ceremony. Promptly at 8:00 o&#x27;clock the wedding march was played by Mrs. H. C. Bowers, violinist and Miss Grace
Hunting, pianist, and the bridal party took their places. Miss Blanche Mourer, daughter of the groom, acted as bridesmaid
and Clare Seeley, nephew of the bride, was best man. After hearty congratulations and best wishes, H. C. Bowers, master of
ceremonies, announced that supper was ready to serve in the dining room. The decorations were cut flowers and potted
plants, the prevailing color being pink and white throughout the rooms, excepting in the parlor where the ceremony was
performed was a centerpiece of deep red roses. The bride wore a beautiful embroidered gown of sandcolored chiffon over
taffata silk. She carried a white prayer book in which were enclosed six brides rose buds. The bridesmaid wore white
embroidered voile with pink trimmings. The goom and the best man were dressed in blue. The bride was formerly a
Courtland girl but later in life became one of Rockford&#x27;s ladies, she being well known in musical circles and is an artist of
much ability. The groom was formerly of Cannonburg but has been a resident of this place over four years. He holds a
