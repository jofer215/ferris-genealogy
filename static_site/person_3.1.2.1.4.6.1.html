            <div class="person-text">(3.1.2.1.4.6.1) SALLY MARIA SLAWSON born June 16, 1815 Minisink, Orange, NY and died June
23, 1842 (June 21, 1878) Winslow Township, Jefferson Co PA; married September 13, 1831 in Luzerne
Co PA, Truman Beaman London [son of Isaac &amp; Sarah (Callender) London] born October 11, 1808
Luzerne Co PA and died April 11, 1891 Winslow Township, Jefferson Co PA. Truman received a good
education. Upon reaching manhood he engaged in lumbering for 7 years on the north branch of the
Susquehanna. He sold the lumber at various points along the river, Harrisburg, Columbia, Marietta,
Port Deposit. In November of 1837 he and his family along with Parliment Hutchins and his wife
Esther who was Sally Maria&#x27;s sister started for Jefferson Co. After 11 days travel through all kinds of
weather they arrived in Brookville on the 18th day of the month having made the entire trip on a twohorse wagon. He was still involved in lumbering. In 1840 he moved to Perry Township on a farm,
which he cleared and cultivated. In 1843 he settled in Bell Township. In 1848 he made a permanent
home in Winslow Township. He was very active in the development of Jefferson Co. He served one
term as auditor for the county. Per Coulter, he was the lumber and coal man of the tribe, having
engaged in these businesses near Rathmel &amp; having become quite wealthy therein. The London Mines
of that section are still famous throughout the region. He lived retired for some time before his death,
which occurred April 11, 1891 on his farm in Winslow Township. He and some members of his family
are shown in the 1860 Jefferson Co., PA census. He is buried in Prospect Cemetery, Winslow Twp
(Photo). The progenitors of T.B. London were English, and his grandparents on both the paternal and
maternal side lived and died in Luzerne County, Pa. These were Edward London, a native of New
Jersey, and Samuel Callender, born in Virginia. They won an honorable right to the soil of the
Republic, for themselves and their posterity, by patriotic devotion to the spirit of 1776, during the long
and trying carnage of the Revolution. His father, whose name was Isaac born in New Jersey, and his
mother, whose maiden name was Sarah Callender a native of Conn; the former died in Luzerne Co
1843, and the latter Jefferson Co 1846. Truman Beaman London born in Luzerne Co (now
Lackawanna) on the 11th day of October 1808, and was the second child of a family of nine. By self
endeavors and in the public schools he received a very thorough education in the place of his nativity,
where he grew up to manhood, and where he was engaged in the lumber trade until 1837. He
manufactured lumber and marketed it at Harrisburg, Columbia, Marietta, Port Deposit, and other points

on the Susquehanna River. On September 13, 1831, he was united in wedlock to Sally Mariah
Slawson, which union was blessed with offspring, numbering six, divided equally as to sex. Their
names, in consecutive order of birth, are Martha Jane, born July 28, 1832; Eliza Mariah, March 9,
1834; Truman Beaman, March 10, 1836; Isaac, September 3, 1838; Moses Slawson, January 31, 1841;
Mary Ann, May 29, 1842. The first and the last two are deceased. Their mother died June 23, 1842. Of
those living, Isaac is a wide awake and successful merchant of Reynoldsville, and a man greatly
esteemed by all who know him; Truman B. is a successful farmer of Winslow Township; and Eliza M.,
who married Andrew Johnston, is a resident of DuBois, Clearfield County, and the wise mother of an
interesting family. The subject of this biography emigrated from Luzerne County to Jefferson, locating
in Brookville in 1837. Upon his advent there he found such representative citizens as Judge Heath,
John Heath, the Dunham, Dr. Jenks, Barclay Jenks, Drs. Bishop and Darling, who were the physicians
of the town, Samuel Truby, Jared Evans, Levi G. Clover, Thomas Hastings, John Dougherty, etc.
Barclay Jenks was the most brilliant member of the bar, and Mr. London, in his enthusiastic
reminiscences of him, says: &quot;It took somebody better than a Philadelphia lawyer to equal our
backwoods Blackstone.&quot; Dr. Jenks, his father, and also father of the present Solicitor-General of the
United States, George A., was then one of the associate judges. Judge Evans was in the banking
business, known at that time as a &quot;shin-plaster office&quot;. He issued notes in various denominations up to
a dollar, which were made current in the community, and when any one had accumulated these to the
amount of five dollars or over, they were redeemable at the counter of the Judge, who gave large bills
in exchange. Mr. London, who was in the mercantile business in a limited way, enjoyed the benefits of
Evans&#x27;s banking system. In 1840 Mr. London removed from Brookville, where he had been engaged
in lumbering, to Perry Township, and there cleared a farm purchased of C.C. Gaskill; and in 1843 he
settled in Bell Township in the midst of his lumber operations. Six years later he located permanently
in Winslow Township, near the site of his present residence, on the farm now occupied by Fulton
Henry. He contracted matrimony again in 1846, by leading to the altar of Hymen Mrs. Sarah (Wilkins)
Rea, who succumbed to the inevitable in 1878. The record of T.B. London&#x27;s life is that of an active and
useful man - useful to himself, his family, his community, and his county. Aside from clearing and
working many farms, his lumber operations, in which he was a pioneer on Sandy Lick Creek, gave
employment to hundreds of men at a time when the less venture some and poorer classes needed just
such an enterprising spirit to lead them. He opened up roads, often at his own expense, leading into
remote districts, thus creating settlements and adding to the population and welfare of the county. In
his later years his capital has erected a score of houses in Reynoldsville and Winslow Township, and
was invested in a mercantile enterprise in the town mentioned for about eight years. His life has ever
been identified with the best interests of the local public, vigilant at all times, and always ready to do
good. He served one term as auditor of the county. To the church, too, he has been kind, giving
generously to every creed that knocked on his heart, asking for help. His character and career may be
summed up in this sentence: Honest, liberal, true, enterprising, companionable, intelligent, sagacious and what more can be expected of a noble man!
