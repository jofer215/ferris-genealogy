            <div class="person-text">(1.1.4.4.1.3.1.6.1) JOSEPHINE LORETTA VALLY born July 1, 1906 Park Falls, Price,
WI and died September 17, 1992 at the Sisters of St. Francis of Assisi, South Milwaukee
WI; buried in their plot in Holy Sepulcher Cemetery, Cudahy, Milwaukee, WI (Photo);
her gravestone there is inscribed &quot;Sister Joann Vally 1906-1992&quot;. According to her
funeral liturgy, given by Sister Doris Hachmeister, of the Order of St. Francis, Josephine
grew up in Park Falls where the family was members of the St. Anthony’s Church. At
the age of 16, in January 1923, she entered the postulate at St. Francis Convent and was
received into the novitiate the same year and given the religious name of Sister Mary
Samuel, which was later changed to Sister Joann, of the order of St. Francis of Assisi.
She celebrated her first profession of her vows on August 12, 1925. In February 1926
she received her mission assignment to teach first grade at St. Sebastian School in
Milwaukee. Josephine’s subsequent teaching ministry of 51 years was chiefly devoted to
upper-grade students and took place in various states. During this time, she continued
her education and earned a Masters of Arts degree in Reading. In 1977, she returned to
St. Mary’s Academy where she spent the last six years of her professional life working

in the guidance office, while living in the Motherhouse. She retired in 1983. Two years
later she moved to St. Ann Center before entering the Marian Franciscan Home in
Milwaukee where she remained until her death. Sister Joann had musical and artistic
ability, but had received no formal training in those areas. She played the piano by ear
and enjoyed playing lively tunes and songs frequently. She was also an excellent
seamstress.</div>
