            <div class="person-text">(3.10.1.2.1.10.2) NATHAN NORTHRUP NASH born April 2, 1808 Sherburne, Chenango, NY and
died July 11, 1854 Elizabeth, JoDaviess, IL; buried Plum River Cemetery, Stockton, JoDaviess, IL

Williams [dau of Seth &amp; Mary (Stover) Williams Jr] born 1815 Granby, Oswego, NY and died 1890
JoDaviess Co IL; also buried Plum River Cemetery. Nathan injured his arm while helping to erect a
