south of Rock Falls, Illinois, then at the age of 10 we moved to Tampico, Illinois on the Pearson Farm,
which was owned by our Grandparents Victor E. and Martha Pearson. Our grandparents moved to
Shore Acres in Rock Falls, Illinois then to a new home in Prophetstown, Illinois. I went to school at
Tampico, helped my father Kenneth farm. We farmed until I went into the Army in March 1957. I was
at Fort Leonard Wood MO for basic training. Then I married Francis Rhode, then after basic training to
Fort Lee, VA for 8 weeks, in which she went with me. After 8 weeks of training I received notice of
being transferred to Verdun, France. I brought Francis home, then was shipped to Fort Dix, New Jersey
for several days. Flew overseas to France, for 18 months. Did some traveling while there. My first son
born at home on April12, 1958. I got out of service on March 1959. Came home to my family and
farmed with my father again. We had a home built and lived next door to my folks. Our second son,
Gary born November 5, 1960. We raised a lot of hogs, farrowed them to finish. After both of my
parent’s death, I continued to raise hogs. In 1988, I got rid of all my hogs and sold the machinery and
rented the land out to my neighbor. I worked at Alto Irrigation for 3 ½ years and then went to work in
1992 for Egan Brothers at Harmon, Illinois. Frances and I have 4 grandchildren and enjoy doing things
with them.” (2001). Frances has always been a very hard worker. Before she was married, she worked
in the offices of the Northwestern Steel and Wire Company in Sterling/Rock Falls IL. After her
children grew up she worked at the restaurant in Tampico. Born to them were:</div>
