This letter was written by Sarah Jane Ferris (then, Sarah Stephenson) on April 27, 1910. &quot;A little of my life&#x27;s experiences, at
the urgent request of my children. &quot;I was born August 22nd, 1821, in Elizabethtown, Essex County, State of New York. My
mother died soon after I was 4 years old. I lived at home until 8 years of age then with a cousin on my father&#x27;s side for
nearly 2 years. Then with an uncle on my mother&#x27;s side until 13 years old. &quot;In the meantime, I learned to spin wool and flax.
I seemed to be the only one who could be spared from home, but spinning was learned at home. Was not brought up in
idleness in either place. &quot;In 1836, I left my dear father&#x27;s home with a married sister for a home in Michigan. Arrived in

Detroit the fourth of July after a three weeks journey by canal and Lake Erie. We were both sick with ague and fever a great
deal of the time. &quot;I worked at housework and nursing, when not sick. At 15, was baptized and a young man and his sister,
who were strangers to me, joined at the same time. Have been a member of the M.E. church ever since. Have made many
mistakes, not meaningly. [&quot;M.E.&quot; stands for Methodist Episcopal Church, a term used to designate the Methodist Church in
the northern U.S. The &quot;Episcopal&quot; refers to a form a governance and not the Anglican Church.]&quot;In 1839, was married to
your father [Edwin Zenas Glass] on January 13th, being past 17 years old and your father was 25. We lived together over 18
years, he dying and leaving me with a family of six children. Will not attempt to describe the difficulties that were passed
through, which were many as there were only 2 of the children old enough to help provide for our family. I sewed, worked,
house cleaned and nursed to help provide. God helped me, gave me good health. Milton, my eldest, enlisted in the war of
the Rebellion in 1864. That was another trial. Seemed I could not spare him. While he was in the war, I married again [Isacc
F. Perrin]. Lived within a 4 mile radius of the vicinity where I first landed, with the exception of 2 years, for a period of 65
years. [Milton enlisted in the 16th Regiment of the Michigan Volunteer Infantry on August 15th, 1861 and died in the Battle
of Cold Harbor in June 1864.] &quot;If I could have written my life&#x27;s experience as they came, it might have been easier, but to
bring it up and live it over, I cannot. It breaks me all up. When this life is over, I hope to be where there is no more sin or
sorrow. My great desire is to see my children that are left to me, Christians, trying to make a better world. That would
rejoyce my heart more than anything else.&quot;Sarah Jane Stephenson&quot;
