            <div class="person-text">(5.1.1.5.1.1.5) CHAUNCEY WASHINGTON FERRIS born September 22, 1811 Cato, Cayuga, NY
and died February 11, 1889 Hillsdale MI [Jim - Chaplain Ferris spelled his name ‘Chauncey’, but the
1860 census has it without the ‘e’, so I will go with the census, especially since Chaplain Ferris spelled
Chauncy, Jr., without the ‘e’; apparently the census was wrong – a document shows his name with the
‘e’]; married 1st September 27, 1838 Julia Maria Smith born January 7, 1817 and died April 28, 1841;

married 2d October, 10, 1844 at Hillsdale, Catherine Ann Wolford born June 10, 1816 and died August
22, 1850; and 3d November 12, 1851 Phebe Elizabeth Hedges born April 1, 1822 and died May 30,
1911. Chauncy was one of the earlier pioneers of Hillsdale MI. He built a large brick house there in
1845, at Number 9 North Street. In partnership with a Mr. Cook, Chauncy open the settlement’s first
store. There apparently was no offspring from the first marriage. Listed in the 1860 census of Hillsdale
County, Hillsdale Village; in this same census, there was a Corneluis, age 22 and Luthren, age 7
residing in the household. Speculate that Cornelius was (5.1.5.1.8.5), Chauncy’s nephew. Further
speculation is that the Luthren, age 7, might have been a son of Luther, Chauncy’s brother, although
there is no offspring shown.]
John Potter Cook and Chauncey Ferris, his friend, were the third and fourth men to come to Hillsdale. They
proved to be the &quot;movers and shakers&quot; for the community during their entire lifetime. These two men, at the age
of 20, left their home in Cato, New York to journey to the west with a wagonload of mercantile goods. They
stopped first in the small settlement of Jonesville and established the first store. However, by 1834 they decided
that Hillsdale offered them more opportunities. In 1838 they set up the first grist mill using the mill pond race as
it merged with the St. Joseph River. It was a simple mill using only a millstone and a water wheel to furnish
power but from 1838, a mill on this same site has continued to operate to the present time. (The mill was
purchased from Ferris and Cook by F.W. stock in 1869 and was operated by that same family for more than 80
years.) One humorous note concerning Cook was, that as the settlement evolved into a village, he was
designated as the wrestler to test any newcomer to the area. Together, Ferris and Cook platted much of the
settlement which became Hillsdale. These two men, with foresight knew development would be enhanced with a
railroad connection. Cook, becoming a contractor for Michigan Southern Railroad, and working with Henry
Waldron and Charles T. Mitchell (two more of the early settlers), was able to extend the railroad from Adrian in
Lenewee County, where it had ended, to Hillsdale. Recognizing the benefit, the men then erected warehouses
along the terminus in Hillsdale in order that products might be shipped from the area. By being instrumental in
organizing Hillsdale as a county in 1835, Cook was appointed Treasurer and Ferris became the County Clerk.
Ferris also was elected supervisor and served as a school commissioner and as mayor of Hillsdale. Appointed by
President Martin Van Buren, Cook became Hillsdale&#x27;s first Postmaster. The two men were also given the task of
building the first frame Court House. Additionally, Cook served in 1845 in the State Legislature and then in the
State Senate. He also was elected to two state Constitutional Conventions in 1850 and 1870 when Michigan
framed its State Constitution. With his friends, Waldron, Mitchell and Ferris, Cook organized the first bank in the
village and then in 1874 established the Hillsdale Savings Bank. Cook labored for his community tirelessly as a
member of the Hillsdale Board of Education and the Board of Trustees of Hillsdale College when it was moved
from Spring Arbor in 1844. Through Cook&#x27;s efforts the Hillsdale County Fair was organized and Cook served as
its first Treasurer. Hillsdale was well served by the work and the promotion throughout their lives by John Potter
Cook and Chauncey Ferris.
