            <div class="person-text">(2.1.4.1.3.9) SAMUEL PERCIVAL FERRIS born April 6, 1830 Blakely Township, Lackawanna
Township, PA and died June 9, 1908 Wilsey, Morris, KS; (cemetery unk, there is a Wilsey Cemetery,
Morris Co KS, but do not know if he was buried there) married November 17, 1854 Laduska Jane
Brown born August 27, 1835 PA and died June 30, 1903 KS. Samuel served in the Civil War with
Company A, 124th Illinois Infantry Regiment, registering in Kewanee IL. The 124th was a
representative, self-raised Regiment, recruited from Henry, Kane, McDonough, Sangamon, Jersey,

Adams, Wayne, Cook, Putnam, Pike, Mercer and Christian Counties. On August 27, 1862, the first
company went into camp at Camp Butler, near Springfield - six days later, all companies were in camp.
September 10th, all were mustered in the United States service for three years. It is written that the
Regiment had been involved in 14 skirmishes, 10 battles and 2 sieges of 47 days and nights and 13
days and nights respectively, and so had been under fire eighty-two days and sixty nights. The
Regiment was one of the most fortunate in the service. It always obeyed orders, taking and holding
every position to which it was assigned unflinchingly. The Regiment was never repulsed, never
retreated a step in the face of a foe and never lost a prisoner in action. Born to Samuel and Laduska
