            <div class="person-text">(1.4.1.5.7.2) HENRY FERRIS (Harry) married Elvira C. Caswell
Brooklyn Eagle, September 23, 1873: In the Supreme Court this morning the following case came to light. The parties to
it are Mrs. Elvira C. Ferris and her husband, Henry Ferris. The lady was formerly Miss Elvira Caswell, and she, as well as
her husband, was well known “on the Heights,” having lived in Montague street for a number of years, and gone in the best
society that Brooklyn affords. On the 14th of December, 1865, she and Mr. Ferris were married. Her husband was her equal
in social standing, a young man doing a good business, a member of the Brooklyn Club and received everywhere. They took
up their residence at the Pierrepont House and were living there during the greater part of the year 1870. In July of that year
Kate Browning came to the Pierrepont House to live also. She was a professional actress and had an engagement at the Park
Theatre. She was handsome and she was engaging. So much so that Mr. Ferris was sufficiently attracted to her to pay her
more attention that his wife thought strictly proper. She separated from him and in the Spring of the year commenced a suit
against him for a divorce, alleging this commission of adultery with the fair Thespian. Mr. Ferris denied the soft
impeachment, employed counsel and put in his defense. The case was referred to Gerard M. Stevens, Esq., to take proof.
Before him, Wm. Rovondt, a bookkeeper at the Pierrepont House, was the only witness. He testified that he had seen Mr.
Ferris and Miss Browning talking together in the parlor of the Pierrepont House, that he had seen him waiting for her
outside of the Park Theatre; had seen them go to the Pierrepont House from the theatre in company, separating at certain
corner, and going round the block. He testified also that he had seen Mr. Ferris walking in the direction of Miss Browning’s
room, and coming from the direction of her room at late hours of the night. From the footfalls he judged one night that Mr.
Ferris had gone to the room. No testimony was put in by the referee on the part of Mr. Ferris, and Mr. Stevens, the referee,
reported in favor of granting an absolute decree to the wife. It is to be supposed that the counsel of Mr. Ferris did not deem
the testimony of Mr. Rovondt sufficient to base a decree upon, but the report was presented to Judge Pratt, and he confirmed
it. The motion this morning, before Justice Pratt, was to open the judgment and allow Mr. Ferris to put in testimony before
the referee on his own behalf. Mr. Bergen presented affidavits by Mr. Ferris and Miss Browning, denying in toto the charges
of criminality, and all the material allegations made by Rovondt, and also an affidavit of merits. Mr. Osborne presented in
addition to the testimony of Rovondt, an affidavit of his own, in which he swore that before the action was commenced he
sent for Mr. Ferris, and told him that he was going to bring the action, and that Mr. Ferris then and there acknowledged the
charge upon which the action was based. In addition, he presented the affidavits of Mr. Charles N. Peed and others, to show
that Mr. Ferris was living at the Pierrepont House in 1870, etc. In answer to Mr. Osborne’s affidavit, an affidavit was drawn
up and sworn to by Mr. Ferris, at once, in which he said that what Mr. Osborne had sworn to, was false. After the argument,
Judge Pratt took the papers and reserved his decision.
