MISS JOSEPHINE BRANAUGH DIES AT HER WINDHAM RESIDENCE
The death, last Wednesday, April 7, of Miss Josephine Branaugh, the daughter of the late Thomas and Angeline (Ferris)
Branaugh, marks the closing of the earthly existence of another of Windham&#x27;s lifelong residents. For several months she had
been in declining health, suffering with a heart ailment. Miss Branaugh born when her parents resided on their North
Settlement farm, now owned by Mrs. Julia Johnson. While yet she was a young girl, the family moved to what for many
years was known as the Branaugh Farm east of Brooksburg. During her young womanhood her parents purchased and took

up their residence on the property, lower Main St. Windham, where they spent their remaining years. The subject of this
sketch will be kindly remembered by her neighbors and friends throughout her native town and by those who each summer
were sojourners at Cedar Lawn Farm. They admired her for her various traits of character which she displayed in a modest
yet thoroughly sincere manner. Her charitable ministrations, which were many and enhanced by her spirit of willingness and
courtesy, will be missed. Her natural gifts were moulded by those attributes which are given by the full development of a
wholesome natural life. Hers was an unassuming manner, her influence was for good. She possessed a feeling of tenderness
for others in their trials and misfortunes. Her self-oblivion, her happiness with her home and the love for those who shared it
with her, were prominent in her life. The funeral of Miss Branaugh was conducted from the house on Monday afternoon at
two o&#x27;clock, interment was in Pleasant Valley cemetery. The Rev. C. F. Robson of the Windham Presbyterian church
conducted the services, speaking very fittingly from John, 11:25. &quot;I am the resurrection and the life.&quot; A quartette from the
choir of that church rendered two appropriate hymns. The floral tributes were beautiful and in profusion. Henry Branaugh, a
brother of the deceased, his son, Birdsall, and his daughter, Miss Dora, are the immediate survivors. Besides these there are
many other relatives and friends.</div>
