            <div class="person-text">(3.1.9.1.9.4.3.2.2) MARY ELIZABETH JEWELL (Photos) born August 18, 1886 Jackson, Jackson, MI
and died September 14, 1931 Warren, McComb, MI; result of a car accident; buried Royal Oak
Cemetery, Royal Oak, Oakland, MI (Photo); married c1905 in Jackson MI, Boyd Hampton Spicer [son
of Alzie &amp; Delzina (Pickens)] born March 24, 1887 Warsaw, Kosciusko, IN and died December 1964
Detroit MI; it is said he died a very lonely and sick old man. In 1936 resided in Homer MI. In 1931,
during the depression, the family lived on Coy Street in Hazel Park, a suburb of Detroit. Mary was
apparently working in Detroit and while riding to or from work in a car driven by another woman, was
involved in a car-truck accident and was killed. After Mary’s death, and with Boyd suffering from TB,
he allowed the children services to distribute the kids as they saw fit. Donald, the oldest, apparently
didn’t like this and fought with his father about it; he wound up leaving his family and changing his last
name to Voightlander, which is the name he used the rest of his life. Della was sent to a children’s home
where she was sterilized and traumatized to the point that she spent most of her life in a mental
institution. Sadie was handed over to a 2d cousin on Boyd’s side name Priest; Sadie turned over very

bitter and will say little about it. Virginia was adopted out of the family and for a time didn’t know her
family or who she was; she must have been able to find them before she died as Sadie and Della both
knew her and her children. Boyd Jr., age 19, probably went out on his own also because his widow said
that he tried for years to find the rest of his family, with no luck. Born to Mary and Boyd were:</div>
