[son of Richard Walcott &amp; Jane (McDowell) Pelton] born December 22, 1804 Ithaca NY and died
August 12, 1878 Farmer&#x27;s Valley; they moved to Farmer&#x27;s Valley, McKean Co PA 1831; he was a good
man and brought up his children to obey the Golden Rule. In his early days at Farmer&#x27;s Valley he
bought and sold large quantities of fur. In later years was engaged in the lumber business, and in
looking up and selecting timberlands for speculation. He also did much work as land surveyor. From
his obit: Mr. Pelton was one of the first settlers of McKean County, coming here when there was only a
bridle path to Warren and Ridgeway and through Potter county to Wellsboro. He at one time, probably
fifty years ago, sold goods in Smithport. He lived to see the county he chose for his home when a
howling wilderness, transformed to a commercial emporium and become a network of railways,
draining a most productive oil field. His probity of morals and integrity won for him the friendship and
esteem of all who knew him, whose sympathies now go forth to and remain with his widow and
relatives in this their time of bereavement. Born to them were:
