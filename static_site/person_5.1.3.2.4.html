            <div class="person-text">(5.1.3.2.4) FREDERICK FERRIS (AFN: MCV8-MG) (1784-1845) married 1809/10(?), Susannah
Nichols (AFN: MCV8-NM) (1791-1832). It is said that Frederick came from Connecticut to Ohio in
May, 1813/14 - in his party were John Ferris, Captain Robert Barnard and family, David Hobby and
family and two other families. His own family consisted of Susannah, William, Ann, Susan, John and
Caroline, all born in CT. [This conflicts with the birth dates as shown below] Each family, with a

said that their children. Catherine, James, Mary, Samuel, Allison, Isaiah and an infant were born in IN.
