year from the time of my decease and then to be manumitted according to Law but if the
Overseers of the Poor for the Town of Westchester shall after time refuse to manumit
them as the Law directs then I direct my Executors to do it in such way as they shall
judge most proper so that they may be actually free. My boy Israel is to live in the
service and employ of my said son David as usual on the Farm until he shall be

twenty-one years of age and then to be free. 13thly whereas my daughter Anne Pell hath

and good will among my children after my death desire that they may be also satisfied
with her conduct and come to amicable settlements with her but if any of my children
who arfe legatees in the will of their father shall cause vexation in law or otherwise to
my said daughter Anne Pell as an executrix aforesaid in the settlement of his or her share
of the estate in such case I do order and direct my executors to withhold and retain
whatever may be given by this my will to any or either of my children from such child
and his or her assigns who shall cause vexation or lawsuit and distribute the same among
the other legatees share and share alike.
And lastly I nominate constitute and appoint my daughter Anne Pell Executrix and my
sons Edward and George Ferris Executors of this my last Will and Testament hereby
