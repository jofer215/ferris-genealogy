            <div class="person-text">(3.10.1.2.1.9.4.5.1.4) CLARENCE ARTHUR DARBY born July 3, 1896 Clarksville, Iowa and died
August 28, 1985,Waterloo, Black Hawk, Iowa; married May 10, 1918 in Charles City IA, Katie Sutter
born September 21, 1894, Plainfield, Bremer, Iowa and died May 29, 1990, People&#x27;s Memorial
Hospital, Independence, Buchanan County, Iowa. “Grandma Katie Darby &amp; Grandpa Clarence Darby
were truly two of the wonderful people! Grandpa took great delight in playing with his grandchildren.
He had a big, deep, booming, bass voice. He would walk out to the pasture with the grandchildren &amp;
call the cows with that deep bass voice &quot;Come Boss, Come Boss&quot;. He walked along singing hymns
everywhere he went in that deep bass voice. According to his grandchildren, one of the best thing he
used that big deep voice for was playing a game called &quot;COME TO MY SHEEP PEN&quot;! This game

involved Grandpa leaning back in his recliner, reading the newspaper, while you laughed, &amp; screamed
with excitement, &amp; ran away to hide! When you were all done hiding, he would shout &quot;COME TO MY
SHEEP PEN! Are you behind the bed? And you had to answer! He would guess where you were, &amp;
then of course you would have to move, running out of the hiding place as you yelled &quot;No, I&#x27;m not
there!&quot; &amp; as you ran in front of his chair for a new hiding place, he&#x27;d reach to grab you! It was just so
exciting! This could go on for hours, although sometimes Grandpa would lean back in his recliner &amp;
doze off while you were hiding, if it went on to long, so it probably was not nearly as exciting for him
as it was for the grandchildren! It was so much fun!!! And what kid could forget: &quot;Itsey, Bitsey,
Tiggity, Fig, Alla Balla Dominig! Itsiee, Bitsiee Dominitsee, Alla, Balla, Boo, with the &quot;Boo&quot; being a
little jab in the tummy! Or &quot;The little Bumblebee comes out of the barn, &amp; he buzzes, &amp; buzzes
around&quot;...then a little jab in the tummy when you were least expecting that bee to get you! Grandpa
followed the &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; comic strips in the paper &amp; always had the newest funny thing
Dennis had done that day to tell about! Grandson Ken remembers going in Grandpa&#x27;s garage and just
looking around in amazement at all those old license plates lining the walls inside of his garage! And he
tells this cute story about Grandpa remembering what a great sense of humor Grandpa had! &quot;Grandpa
and Grandma would come visit us and Grandpa would help out. We had a few horses for a while. One
fall when they were visiting Grandpa was feeding them for us. He had just thrown some feed over the
fence into their area, turned around, bent over, and Prince (A young Colt), decided that Grandpas&#x27;
overalls looked like a nice dessert! He proceeded to take a bit out of Grandpas&#x27; back pocket. A neighbor
was also over and happened to see what happened, had quite a laugh, and many more good times with
this incident, all on poor Grandpa&#x27;s misfortune. Well this particular neighbor was known for liking to
kid people and of course he never let Grandpa forget this. (The grandchildren also helped Grandpa not
to forget his friendly horse either!!) Grandpas&#x27; good nature and attitude was more then happy to go
along with our kidding.&quot; Grandma &amp; Grandpa&#x27;s lives spanned the time of the greatest technological
improvements the world has ever seen. They were both born in the last part of a century when their
parents and grandparents pioneered in Butler County, Iowa from New York, and Germany, and used
horsepower only to do their farm work. They lived with the early automobile, enjoyed the &quot;new,
improved models&quot;, went through lots of innovations in farm equipment, and kitchen gadgets, and
towards the end of their life, flew to visit their family by jet airplane, and watched a man walk on the
moon, &amp; took it all in stride, enjoying every minute of it! The telephone that first hung on the wall in
their parlor was a huge oak box with the earphone on a cord and the mouthpiece in the wall unit. They
were on a party line, of course, and answered only &quot;2 shorts and a long&quot; ring. (Sometimes the
grandchildren would answer other rings, though, and oh, what fun it was to
eavesdrop !) ROCKFORD IOWA NEWS, August 29, 1985

“The thing I remember most about Grandma were her kind loving ways. She loved little animals, and
birds, and could whistle a perfect imitation to many birdcalls. She saved oatmeal from breakfast every
day to feed the little barn cats on the back porch, and although the grandchildren might have been
trying unsuccessfully to catch those little cats for many hours, they would come right out when it was
oatmeal time and she called! She loved flowers, and had beautiful flower gardens each year, full of tall
rows of &quot;glads&quot;, holly hocks, always a sunflower or two, along the fence, and rows and rows of other
beautiful flowers, in addition to garden produce. She especially liked pansy&#x27;s she said &quot;because they
have little faces! She remembered every birthday of her growing family and always picked cards with
the prettiest flowers on them, to write a special &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; in her very small, precise letters. Her
favorite color was blue, and she loved bluebirds, blue wallpaper, blue prints for dresses, just loved blue
- it matched her beautiful blue eyes. She had very long wavy hair, but it was always tied in a French
roll so you never knew how long it was, unless you happened to be lucky enough to be watching when
she was putting it up in the morning or taking it down for the night! She always wore dresses, never,
ever, pants. She had a favorite apron pattern from &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Wife&quot; magazine, for a quilt block
apron that pinned at the top. She always made pretty aprons to wear everyday over her dresses, when
working around the house. She really liked things to look pretty, and made everything in the home so
pretty, and cozy. Grandson Ken says when he thinks of Grandma he remembers her sitting in her own
easy chair or couch knitting, quilting, or crocheting - working on things to make her home pretty!
Grandma could cook for the whole family on Sunday, big dinners for lots of people at one time, and
everything turned out perfect - cooked from scratch - pies, cakes, chicken, cole slaw, mashed potatoes
and wonderful gravy, homemade pickles, and sauerkraut, rhubarb sauce, gooseberry jam, homemade
jellies, the best cookies you&#x27;ve ever eaten, with the raisins soaked for a while to make them plumper
and juicier, baked right into the cookies; walnuts baked right into the melted chocolate chips in the
chocolate chip cookies. At Christmas time, little perfect white cookie squares with pictures imprinted
on them, hard as a rock, but good for dunking, the licorice (anise) taste that only Grandma&#x27;s Springerle
Cookies could bring were to be made! Grandma Katie&#x27;s mother, Anna &quot;Mary&quot; Scheidecker Sutter, was
called &quot;Little Grandma&quot;, because of her tiny, tiny size. She was born in Baden, Baden, Germany in
1871 &amp; came to the United States with her family in 1883. She never learned to speak English very
well, but was a wonderful cook like her daughter. She also made those wonderful Springerle&#x27;s every
Christmas for many years, and so her brother&#x27;s wife, Aunt Martha Scheidecker. Grandma &amp; her mother,
&quot;Little Grandma&quot;, spoke in German to each other. Grandson Ken remembers having fun listening to
them talk and trying just to learn a word or two from them. When Grandma&#x27;s five children were
youngsters, son Raymond remembers Grandma Katie Darby, his mother, making five loaves of bread
every night, and leaving the bread dough to rise on the dining room table all night. Sometimes, if it was
a little to warm, she would come out in the morning to find the dough had risen so much and it was all
over the dining room table! Down in Grandma &amp; Grandpa&#x27;s basement, the walls were lined with
homemade shelves of home canned tomatoes, beets, corn, peas, pickles of all different kinds,
applesauce, &amp; more homemade jams &amp; jellies than you could imagine! If you stayed overnight at
Grandma &amp; Grandpa&#x27;s house, at breakfast time you could pick a Bible verse out of the package kept on
the kitchen table. That was the &quot;Word for the day&quot;! Then Grandpa always included each on of the
children &amp; each one of the grandchildren in a prayer. He &amp; Grandma said their goal was to remember
each one in prayer daily, by name. Many times, I remember hearing Grandpa pray for &quot;Sandy, Lynda,

Susie, Russie, Kenny, Ritchie, Kathy, Dougie &amp; little Tricia Jean&quot;. In the afternoon or evening you
would go upstairs and crawl into a big old fashioned bed with an iron headboard, &amp; snuggle into one of
the big featherbeds under a big, thick, homemade quilt. Grandma&#x27;s quilts were all homemade, very
pretty, &amp; you could pick out your favorite materials from dresses, tea towels, and other familiar things,
while you warmed up in no time! In the &quot;little bedroom&quot; upstairs, there was just a single bed, &amp; the
walls were lined with orange crate shelves, full of old issues of Readers&#x27; Digest, and National
Geographic! What better way to spend an afternoon or evening, than snuggled up on a feather bed, with
a home-made quilt over your legs, reading &quot;Life in These United States&quot; from many decades before
you were even thought of! When you got tired of reading and just kind of drifted off to sleep, you
would first look around at the pretty wallpaper, with inspirational pictures &amp; motto&#x27;s - &quot;Make new
friends, But keep the old, Those are silver, These are gold!&quot; - or scripture verses. What better way to
wake up than when you&#x27;ve drifted off to sleep contemplating &quot;Jesus Never Fails!&quot; Born to them were 4
sons and a daughter. (Family members do not want info on live members published so follow-on
