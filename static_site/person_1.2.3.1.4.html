            <div class="person-text">(1.2.3.1.4) NATHANIEL UNDERHILL of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia; born 1751
Westchester NY, resided as a tenant farmer at Phillipsburg Manor (now Tarrytown) NY
where he, following the lead of the lord of the manor, Frederick Phillipse, remained
loyal to the King and subsequently lost his lands to the revolutionaries; married Rebecca
Ward [dau of Thomas &amp; Freelove (Pinckney) Ward]; Nathaniel appears to have been a
firm and devote loyalist during the Revolutionary War. One occasion he was captured by
a party of Tories or Cowboys, led by Isaac Martlingh, who conveyed their prisoner to a
neighboring farm, suspended him by his feet, compelled him to eat oats off the floor, and

tormentors, declaring he would shoot every one of them if an opportunity should ever
occur; and happening to encounter Martlingh soon afterwards, shot him dead on the
spot, referred to as Tarrytown’s first murder. {Jim - guess that explains why he moved to

gravestone with the following inscription: &quot;In memory of Isaac Martlingh/who was
inhumanly/slain by Nathaniel Underhill/May 26, A.D. 1779/in the 39th year of his
age.&quot;Nathaniel served for at least part of the Revolution in Delancey’s British Legion in
Captain Vernon’s Dragoons. These cavalry units foraged out of the British lines around
New York into the &quot;neutral ground&quot; of upper Westchester Co (including Tarrytown)

below the American lines near Peekskill and rounded up cattle and firewood for the
inhabitants of New York and the British garrison. They were sometimes called
&quot;cowboys&quot;. After the war, Nathaniel and his family removed to New Brunswick, sailing
on the Littledale. Born to them were:</div>
