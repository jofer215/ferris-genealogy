From Milton Ferris Reunion text written by Charles W. Ferris 1934
&quot;It was thought best for lack of time in this historical sketch not to go farther into detail of more than the first and second
generation. Although much might be written of the third and fourth generation, now much in evidence, I am making one
exception because of outstanding achievement by one of the great grand-children, Charlotte Belknap Reynolds, daughter of
Giles and Lula Belknap, who has for many years been a missionary in China, and the letter from which I quote becomes a
part of this sketch as follows: &quot;Charlotte and Paul Reynolds went out under the American Board in 1921 to Fenchow
(Pronounced fun-jo) China. They will soon be closing their second term and are to return for a third term. Charlotte has
helped in very many ways in the mission work, has taught Domestic Science and written a textbook on that subject in
Chinese. She manages the music program for church and schools, and has a school in her own home for her own children
and some of the children of the other missionaries. Dr. Paul Reynolds is Assistant to the Chinese Principal of the Ming I
School (a large school for Chinese boys and girls of High School age), all Chinese schools, now by law having native
Principals. &#x27; &quot;Paul is also Director of a large Civic Center work which last year celebrated its tenth anniversary, and at that
time was taken over by the national Y.M.C.A. He was elected head of the Religious Educational Work of all north China.
Charlotte and Paul have three children. They plan to come home in 1935 for their second furlough.&quot;
