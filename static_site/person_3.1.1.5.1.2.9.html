(3.1.1.5.1.2.10) EDWARD MONTAGUE BLOOMER born November 27, 1841 and died July 1, 1917;
married, Belle {maiden name unk} (Nevada M. Clark); served in Company G, 89th NYVI, Civil War;
for Civil War history buffs: The Honorable Daniel S. Dickinson, the former Senator from the State of
New York received authority on August 29th, 1861 to raise a regiment of infantry. This Regiment was
organized under Col. Harrison Stiles Fairchild. The Regiment was raised in central New York, from
Broome, Delaware, Livingston, Monroe, and Schuyler counties. The companies were recruited
principally as follows: A, at Havana; B and H at Binghamton; C, at Mount Morris; D, at Rochester; E,
at Norwich and Oxford: F, at Whitney Point; G, at Windsor; I, at Delhi; and K, at
Corbettsville. The 89th formally joined together at Elmira late in November, where they lived in
barracks and where they were mustered into the service of the United States on Dec. 4th, 5th, and 6th
of that 1861. The 89th, now formed and mustered, left promptly for Washington on Dec. 6, 1861. They
became known as the Dickinson Guard. They traveled through Pennsylvania on two separate trains.
One train was involved in an accident, but apparently without significant injury. Arriving in the vicinity
of the Washington outskirts, the 89th was assigned to the Army of the Potomac in the defense of
Washington. Those early days were spent establishing their camp, drilling in military fashion, and
getting familiar with their weapons. They were issued muskets, not the hoped-for rifles. Most of the
men had the opportunity to visit the nation&#x27;s capital and many had photographs taken to send to love
ones. Disease, boredom and homesickness not war, were the problems the men faced at this juncture.
The men were anxious to have news of the war and even more so to have news from home. Mail call
and mustering for pay were the most longed-for events, and the only other thing coming close was
hoping for or dreaming about a furlough. For the 89th, the first camp out of New York, which they
called Camp Clay, was not to be home for long. They were soon to leave for further south. The 89th
was assigned in January 1862 to Burnside&#x27;s Expedition to North Carolina. They traveled by transport
from Virginia into the Atlantic to North Carolina. The journey took many of the New Yorkers on their
first ocean voyages. They were nearly four weeks aboard ship, including time lying in harbor. They
first were encamped near Hattaras Inlet, but late in February were ordered to move to Roanoke Island.
There they established a rather comfortable camp that they called Camp Dickinson. From this base,
they landed on the mainland and were engaged at the Battle of South Mills, North Carolina on April
19th. In this action there were 4 men wounded and 2 missing. After long marching in the spring
conditions, including showers and a drizzling rain on their return, they arrived back in their camp
feeling they were part of a victory. They remained at Camp Dickinson until July 10th when they left for
Norfolk, Virginia, arriving on the 12th. This was after McClellan&#x27;s failed 1862 Peninsular Campaign,
and the Union armies were left consolidating their strongholds near the coast. By mid August they were
on the move again. The 89th, still part of the Ninth Corps moved to northern Virginia, and encamped
near Fredericksburgh. Unknown to them, they were approaching the time of their most severe fighting.
This was about the time that Lee was planning his first major invasion of the North. Lee&#x27;s army crossed
the Potomac into Maryland in September, but readers may recall that his movements were known
through the fortuitous find of the orders of movement. The 89th was among the units at the Battle of
South Mountain. Here they attacked the invading Rebel Army. They had 2 killed and 18 wounded that
September 14th, 1862. As the Union army followed slowly after the retreating Rebels, the 89th was
along. Lee arranged his army near Sharpsburg, Maryland, and the Battle of Antietam there on
September 17th resulted when McClellan finally attacked the confederate positions. This battle has the

painful distinction of resulting in more American deaths and woundings in one day than ever had
before or since occurred. The 89th was in the last assault of the day, and as all of the others had, it
failed in the end. The 89th had losses of 18 killed, 77 wounded, and 8 missing. The following day,
McClellan failed to press, Lee retreated, and the Maryland campaign was over. The 89th stayed in the
vicinity, and camped near Harper&#x27;s Ferry, Maryland, recovered when the rebels retreated back to
Virginia. In November, General Burnside replaced General McClellan, and the 89th, which had now
been under the command of Burnside since January, found themselves moving with the Army of the
Potomac into northern Virginia. By the end of November they were in the vicinity of Fredericksburgh,
Virginia. There on December 13, 1863, a great battle was fought. The 89th was arrayed in the Third
Division (General Getty), First Brigade (Col. Rush Hawkins), and was held mainly in reserve, but a
seldom-discussed event occurred on Dec. 11th involving 100 men from the 89th, one of the many
heroic efforts nearly lost in history. This part in the history of the 89th will be mentioned separately
below. The Battle of Fredericksburgh largely fought on the 13th, but straggling in to the 15th of
December produced frightful loss for the Union Army. In all, about 12,000 Union soldiers fell that day,
about 9,000 of them attacking &quot;the wall&quot; at Marye&#x27;s Heights. The 89th had losses of 4 killed (two of
these dying later from wounds), 25 wounded and 1 missing. General Burnside&#x27;s only major battle was a
disaster in the eyes of historians. The Army of the Potomac could muster no further serious action that
winter. Burnside was disgraced and replaced. In February of 1863, the 89th left northern Virginia and
moved to the vicinity of Newport News, Virginia. They were out of tents again, this time in log
barracks. They were in this area until moved against Suffolk, Virginia in March. Officially, the Siege of
Suffolk took place April 11 through May 4, 1863, and the 89th was involved in many aspects of this
action. This included the capture of a rather large battery, known as Battery Hugar on April 19th, and a
successful attack on confederate positions on May 3rd at the Providence Church Road. In the siege, the
89th had 3 killed and 10 wounded. In June, the troops were on the move again, this time to a camp near
Norfolk, Virginia. From here, they were part of the 1863 peninsular movements, mindful of the defeats
in the same regions the year before. By late July there was talk of the drafted men coming to fill the
depleted ranks, and camp life was again routine, then suddenly on July 31st, they found themselves on
board ship again, this time in the Adalaide, and ended in Charleston Harbor region. From their base on
Folly Island, the unit was involved in the support of the various actions against the installations in
Charleston Harbor, including Battery Wagner and the recapture of Fort Sumpter. They were in the
region until later April of 1864 when they were moved back to Virginia. The movement back to
Virginia landed the 89th on the southeast peninsula again. They joined the Siege of Petersburg.
Between May 5th and the fall of 1864, when most of the Regiment was mustered out, there was the
construction of works and there were long stretches in the rifle pits with bullets flying overhead
constantly. Artillery duels abounded, and this trench warfare presaged the later ones of WW I in
Europe. One soldier of the 89th wrote in July of that 1864, &quot;I do not know what to write. It is the same
here one day and samer the next. All the difference I can see is I washed my shirt yesterday and write a
letter today and tomorrow I can stick my fingers in my mouth and wait for it to come night. I hear the
roar of cannon the crack of rifles and the whiz of ball every day till it has become like the roar of a dam
to a miller. I do not know that it is going on only noticing it if it stops for a while.&quot; During this time, the
89th 6 wounded, of whom one died. They also were involved in the Battle of Cold Harbor in June of
1864, where they suffered 3 deaths, 15 men wounded, two of whom later died, and an additional 2

missing. By August, many of the men considered their three years to be up, and were itching to get to
their long missed homes. Mustering out was delayed until November for most of the original three-year
men. Muster records indicate that few of the men reenlisted despite the offer of a bounty for doing so.
In Company I for instance only seven of the company re-upped. The Regiment officially although the
character was much changed by the loss of the hardy veterans, continued in the service in Virginia.
They were present at the final assault on Petersburg, and took part in the Appomattox Campaign in
April of 1865. They were apparently present at the Appomattox Courthouse on April 9th when Lee
surrendered to Grant. The unit was officially mustered out of service at Richmond, Virginia on August
3, 1865, bringing to an end almost four years of toil and death for these New Yorkers in the defense of
their country. Theirs was a small part in the whole aspect of the war, but for these participants of the
Eighty-Ninth New York Volunteer Infantry represented some of the most profound experiences of their
lives. In the aggregate, the unit losses were as follows: Killed in action: 4 officers and 49 enlisted men.
Died from wounds: 2 officers and 52 enlisted men. Died of disease and accident: 1 officer and 158
enlisted men. Of those who died, 13 were in the hands of the enemy at the time of death.
Crossing the Rappahannock - December 11, 1862. The Army of the Potomac, under the command of
General Ambrose Burnsides was north of the Rappahannock River, with Lee&#x27;s army occupying the
town and the heights just south of town. Rebel sharpshooters and artillery were arrayed to prevent the
federals from crossing the river. Gen. Burnside planned to send his army across on three pontoon
bridges, but laying the bridges was a formidable task for the engineers. Early on the morning of the
11th, Col. Fairchild received an order from Gen. Burnside to detail four officers and one hundred of his
men to cross the river in boats, dislodge the rebels, and secure the area for the safety of the bridge
construction. The four officers were: Captain Frank Burt of Company K, Captain James Hazley of
Company B, Captain Seymour Judd of Company G and First Lieutenant Wellington Lewis of Company
H. The men gallantly crossed the river in boats under covering fire of rifle and cannon, but facing the
entrenched rebels on the southern shore. They succeeded in getting across, leaped out of their boats,
and in short order captured the houses used by the sharpshooters. They captured 60 confederate soldiers
and four officers in their raid. They secured the southern shore, allowing the bridge to be safely
completed, and were among the earliest men occupying the town of Fredericksburgh. In the official
reports, the action was highly commended. The report of General Wilcox, commanding the Ninth
Corps, to which the 89th was attached, closed with the statement that the list of the 100 men involved
was attached, but the attachment list has apparently never been found. A compilation was reconstructed
after the war, but was never verified. Many of those who took part recalled later that Gen. Burnside
promised medals to all who took part, and it is known that on the evening of Jan. 2, 1863, a letter was
read to the Regiment from President Lincoln praising the conduct of the men, further fueling the talk of
medals. There were, however, never any medals for these heroes.</div>
