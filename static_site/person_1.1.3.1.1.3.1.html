Obituary: &quot;NEWSPAPER MAN PASSES AWAY
Edgar R. Pearsall, Old Time Resident Succumbs After a Short Illness
Large Church Funeral
Edgar Randolph Pearsall passed away at his home on Ferris Place last Thursday morning, after an illness of three weeks&#x27;
duration. Mr. Pearsall had been a resident of this town for the past thirty-two years, and was well known as a journalist and
military man. He was the founder of the Union County Standard, and all his life had been identified with newspaper work.
Mr. Pearsall was born in Brooklyn on November 3, 1854, he spent his early life in that city until he moved to Westfield. Mr.
Pearsall served as bill clerk in the Assembly when Charles N. Coddling was one of the representatives from Union county.
He was an exempt fireman, being one of the original members of the Westfield Hook and Ladder Company. He was also a
member of Fireside Council, Royal Arcanum, and of the Immediate Aid. For many years the deceased was prominent in
military affairs. He was connected with the National Guard for eighteen years, enlisting in Company C, of Elizabeth, when
that organization was known as the Phil Kearny Guard, under command of Major DeHart. Later Mr. Pearsall joined
Company K, of Plainfield, and after serving as a private, was promoted to the rank of corporal. Later he became sergeant,
and three years ago was commissioned second lieutenant. He held this rank until his commission expired last February. For
several years he had charge of the Boys&#x27; Brigade of Westfield. Mr. Pearsall leaves a widow, three sons, Ferris R. and Chester
B. Pearsall of Westfield, and James F. Pearsall of Melrose, Fla. He also leaves six daughters, the Misses Harriet, Helen,
Virginia, Eleanor and Catherine Pearsall of Westfield, and Miss Ethel Pearsall, of Jacksonville, Fla.
Funeral services were held Saturday afternoon in the First M.E. church, the Rev. A.W. Hayes, of Madison, and the Rev. Dr.
C.M. Anderson, of Plainfield, former pastors of the church, officiating. The service was largely attended, and included
delegations from the fire department, Royal Arcanum and State militia, with which the deceased was closely identified for
many years. The bearers were Ferris and Chester Pearsall, sons of Mr. Pearsall, and C.E. Pearsall, L.M. Pearsall, J.H.
Pearsall, and R.C. Pearsall, nephews of Mr. Pearsall. Interment took place in the family plot in Fairview Cemetery.&quot;
