            <div class="person-text">(3.1.2.2.2.2.6.3) COURTNEY ELLSWORTH FERRIS (this individual is also listed in the (5) James
line, so there is confusion with placement.) born June 28, 1862 DeRuyter NY; married September 12,
1883 in Smyrna NY Carrie Kellogg [dau of John G.] born January 23, 1862 Woodstock IL; he was a
merchant and a Congregationalist; listed as a clerk in the 1892 Smyrna listing; Mayor of Smyrna NY,
1900-01; graduated from Utica Business College; “ Smyrna, Aug. 13. --- On Thursday morning
Smyrna relatives received the sad news of the death of our former townsman Courtney E Ferris at his
home at Berwick, Pa., (Columbia Co) on the evening previous, following an illness of several months.
Mr. Ferris was a native of this section, having been in this village for many years and the many friends
made here by his honest and courteous business methods his earnest and consistent church work and
social and fraternal activities will learn of his passing with deep regret. He was a member of the local
Congregational church and the Sherburne lodge F &amp; AM for many years and was active and earnest in
the work of both. Since moving from this place to Berwick he has held a responsible position with the
Berwick Store Limited. Besides his wife he is survived by four daughters, Mrs. J H Packer of Albany,
Mrs. Jesse Kaustenbauder and Misses Adelaide and Helen Ferris of Berwick, one grandson and one
granddaughter. Funeral services will be held from the home at Berwick at two o&#x27;clock Saturday
afternoon with interment at that place. Smyrna, Aug. 17. --- In reporting the funeral services of our
former townsman, Courtney E Ferris, the Berwick, Pa., Daily Enterprise of August 14, says &quot;The
unusual expression of sorrow at the death of the late Courtney E Ferris and an expression of esteem for
his life and of sympathy for the family were called forth in the funeral services this afternoon. At the
home on East Fourth street, where the services were conducted, were business associates, fellow
churchmen and lodge men, relatives and friends in an unusual number gathered to pay their tribute to
his memory. Floral designs and bouquets in exceptional number gave further evidence of the esteem in
which he was held and of the estimate with which his life was viewed. The Berwick Store company,
with which he had for so many years been connected, is closed in tribute during the afternoon. The
services were conducted by two former Berwick pastors, the Rev. D M Harrison, of Lebanon, Tenn.,
former pastor of the First Presbyterian church, with which Mr. Ferris was for so many years connected
as official member and active worker and Dr. J H Ake, of Harrisburg, former pastor of the First

Methodist church here. The address of Dr. Harrison was one of deep appreciation and comfort. The
cortege went to Pine Grove cemetery (Berwick, Columbia, PA) where the church ritual services were
followed by services conducted by Knapp Lodge, F &amp; A M, with interment conducted with full
Masonic honors, E. E. Reese officiating as worshipful master and the Rev. R. R. Shipe as chaplain. A
lodge of sorrow preceded the attendance at the service of Knapp Lodge in a body. The Rotary Club also
attended the services and the pallbearers were men who were members of both the Masons and the
Rotary Club. The employees of the Berwick Store company attended in a body and acted as honorary
pallbearers.&quot; Born to them were:</div>
