household goods, 2 of my negroes, and a table commonly standing in my middle
room; 2 my sheep, and a warming pan, and all the new cloth shall be for my family. I
leave to my daughter Martha a green sidesaddle, and a bedstead and bed. My wife and
my son William are to maintain my daughter Martha, decently and well, until she comes
to her understanding and reason again; and if she returns to her reason, then my son
William is to pay her oe250. If he refuses to do so, then she is to have 60 acres of land
on the north side joining Sakason’s land, to run the whole length of my land. My wife
Hannah is to have the use of 1/3 of my house and lands during her life, and my daughter
Martha is to live in the house while she remains single. Dated the 22d day of the 2d
