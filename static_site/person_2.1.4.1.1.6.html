            <div class="person-text">(2.1.4.1.1.6) DORCAS FERRIS born 1793 and died October 1, 1832 Ridgeway, Orleans, NY; married
as his first wife, August 15, 1814 Rev Jotham Morse [son of Davis &amp; Miriam (Marsh) Morse] born
June 14, 1793 Providence, Saratoga, NY and died September 18, 1878 Orleans Co NY. From
the Pioneer History of Orleans County NY Biographies, Part II: I born in Providence, Saratoga County,
NY, June 14th, 1793. I was married to Dorcas Ferris August 15th, 1814. I hired a man to move me to
Ridgeway, agreeing to pay him forty dollars for it. Our outfit consisted of a good team of horses and
wagon, as there was no snow then. My family consisted of my mother, my wife and two children. After
we had been two or three days on the road, a ‘thaw’ came that compelled us to stop a week. The earth
then became frozen and we went to Palmyra, when one horse gave out. I bought another horse for
forty-five dollars, paid my watch, a fur hat, and a pair of boots, for thirty-two dollars, and gave my note
for thirteen dollars, and with my three horse team went on to Rochester, when then consisted only of a
few log buildings, one of which was a tavern where we stopped. On examining here I found our only
bed had been stolen. I afterwards found it pawned at Palmyra by the thief and had to pay two dollars
and a half to get it again. We came by the Ridge road to West Gaines, where we found an empty shanty
and moved into it. I went to Batavia through Shelby and procured an article of a piece of land west of
Eagle Harbor, and returned in one day as far as Millville. It snowed hard all day, and I think I did a
good day’s work, traveling so far through the woods on foot. I acknowledge my steps were some
hurried by seeing tracks of wolves in the snow, and seeing evidence of a bloody encounter they had
had. I bought a three year old heifer and paid for her chopping three acres of timber, and fitting it for
logging, going three miles to the place where I did my work. In time of haying and harvest I walked to
Palmyra and worked there three weeks to buy pord and wheat for my family. The next fall I moved into
a log house I had built, and felt at home. The next year I had a little trial such as was common to
pioneer settlers in those days. It was before harvest. My cow has lost her bell, and had been gone in the
woods eight days. We were destitute of provisions, except a small piece of bread, some sugar, and some
vinegar. I went to the nearest place where flour was sold and could get none. On my return we gave the
last morsel of bread to our children. I picked some potato tops, which my wife boiled and we ate,
dressing them with vinegar. Our empty stomachs would not retain this diet. We speedily vomited them
up and retired supperless to bed. Early next morning I arose and went to my neighbors a mile away, and
they divided their small store of flour with me. I carried it home and my wife speedily salted some
water, and made some pudding, which we ate with maple sugar, and this seemed to me to be truly the
best meal of victuals I ever ate, I felt, even in this straight, the words of Solomon to be true: “Better is a
dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and contention therewith.” Another incident. Myself and
immediate neighbors were destitute for flour. I had money, which I had taken in exchange of land, so a
neighbor took me with his team and wagon to Hanford’s Landing, at the mouth of Genesee River, to
purchase flour. I bought six barrels of flour and one barrel of salt and took out my money to pay for it.
Mr. Hanford, the man of whom I had made my, divided the money I handed him into piles of about
thirty-six dollars in each pile, after doing which I was astonished to hear him accuse me, in an angry

tone, of being a dealer in counterfeit money, and to learn that he had condemned about one-half of what
I had paid him. He ordered a man in his employ to go immediately to Rochester and procure a precept
for my arrest. I felt alarmed, and that I was in trouble. I knew not what to do, but God, who is ever
watchful over those things who put their trust in Him, was with me. While things were growing more
threatening, a gentleman whom I had never seen but once before came up, and after learning the facts,
strongly condemned Mr. Hanford’s course. The money was again examined, and only about nineteen
dollars found bad. This was replaced by current funds, and we were then allowed to return to our
homes in peace. This supply carried the settlement through until harvest, and by the blessing of Heaven
and our own industry, and economy, we had been saved from such destitution until the present time. I
have seen the wilderness disappear, and beauty and civilization spring up in its place around me. I
have, in common with mankind, drank at the cup of affliction, perhaps more deeply than many others. I
have been called to mourn over the graves of two loved companions and four children, form a family of
fourteen. I now reside with my third wife, in West Shelby, and preach every Sunday at the Christian
Church in Barre NY, where I have labored in the ministry, more or less, for fifty years – May 1868. He
was ordained a minister in the Christian Church in 1824 and served faithfully 64 years. He became
entirely blind, and was otherwise greatly inflicted for some time before his death. Born to them were:</div>
