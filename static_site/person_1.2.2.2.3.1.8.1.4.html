            <div class="person-text">(1.2.2.2.3.1.8.1.4) JOSHUA UNDERHILL RUMSEY born November 6, 1897 and died
September 20, 1966; married 1st Dorothy Wood - they divorced - no offspring; married
2d Helen Saxbury; resided Elmira NY in the 1950s; from Jim Bennett who knew Joshua,
&quot;Joshua was a very interesting person who lived alone for many years in Elmira with no
visible means of support except the rooms he rented out at 311 West Gray Street, his
home which was proximate to the downtown. Given his age at death, he was
prematurely grey and frail looking for years; would have thought he was in his 70s in the
1950s. He was a distinguished looking gentleman who always wanted visiting kids to
comb his hair; Underhill loved to grow vegetables and was very proud of the growers
edition of the W. Atlee Burpee catalog that he received. Although the yard was not large
(the house was), he managed to grow a large amount of high quality tomatoes,
cucumbers, etc. I must say that kids often dread being dragged to visit adults but

Underhill was such an interesting person it was a pleasure.&quot; Thanks, Jim. Born to them
