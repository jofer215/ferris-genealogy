Jeffrey Ferris and Robert Husted were among the earliest Greenwich settlers, along with Capt. Daniel Patrick and Robert
Feaks, agents for the New Haven Colony.
Born in 1610 in Leicestershire, England, Ferris came to America about 1634. He was made a freeman in Boston
in May 1635 by the General Court of Massachusetts Bay. He soon moved to Connecticut, first to Wethersfield, then to
Stamford and finally to Greenwich. Ferris lived for more than a quarter-century in Old Greenwich until his death in 1666.

“Both Ferris and Husted founded families that over the years helped transform Greenwich into a settled farming
community with the church at the center of its life,” said Douglas Arnold in Greenwich: An Illustrated History.
“The old Ferris homestead was at the entrance gate of the Sound shore where scallops in large quantities were
caught after the first of October,” Frederick Hubbard said in his 1913 book, Other Days in Greenwich.

“During the warm summer days, after the hay had been gathered and the potatoes hoed for the last time, the
farmers from Greenwich and Stamford and some even from Bedford made it a point to give their families an outing on the
broad beach, or they would camp out for a week or two under the great oaks that grow on the point,” Hubbard said.
A descendant of Jeffrey, Samuel Ferris, born in 1733, built a house at the Landing, now Riverside, in 1760. He
was the second son of Samuel and Ann Lockwood Ferris.
In March 1758, Enos Lockwood sold the younger Samuel a half-interest in 12 acres for a farm on the east side
of the Minaus River at the head of Cos Cob Harbor, for 30 pounds in New York money. In November 1758, the estate of
David Lockwood sold the other half-interest to Ferris for 59 pounds and eight shillings.
By 1760, the original house, a National Historic Landmark that bears a plaque by the Historical Society of the
Town of Greenwich, was occupied by Ferris and his wife, Susannah Peck.
The house, remaining in the Ferris family for nearly two centuries, was originally two rooms, with an endchimney. About 1800, after the death of Samuel and Susannah two years earlier, the house and much of the farmland,
known as the Plantation Lot, was quit-claimed by his brothers and sisters to Jonathan, the second son, for $1,000.
In 1799, 10 more acres were added, part of the distribution of the estate of Samuel and Susannah.
Most likely, Jonathan expanded the house after he married Elizabeth “Betsey” Waring. The original rooms were
enlarged, and two rooms to the west were added, along with a new stairway, front door and porch.
Another second son, Samuel Darney Ferris, inherited the house and 20 acres, including the Cedar Lot, in 1846,
and lived there with his wife, Frances Louisa Lockwood, until his death in 1901.
After an expansion and remodeling in 1914, the house was trundled 80 feet north and set down on a new
fieldstone foundation in the 1920s. Rachel Carley, who wrote Building Greenwich: Architecture and Design 1640Present believes the house was moved twice. Hattie Ferris Olmstead, their youngest child, received the property in 1919. A
note in the title search indicates that part of it was deeded to Hattie by a sister, Mary Elizabeth Ferris, who “had not spoken
to him for 40 years,” perhaps referring to her father.
In 1947, Hattie’s daughter, Mable Louise Olmstead, sold the property to the town of Greenwich.
Most of the acreage around the house became veterans’ housing, and in 1957, the house on one acre was sold to
a private buyer for $5,711. It was expanded and remodeled in 1980.
The 1,450-square-foot house on 0.24 acres on Cary Road is listed for sale for $895,000 by Joanna Stohn in the
Greenwich office of Coldwell Banker; Stohn said zoning would allow expansion to 3,800 square feet.
The oldest part of the wood-shingled house is the living room, with fireplace, and the kitchen. The dining room
also has a fireplace, and there’s a den and full bath on the first floor. Up a narrow spiral stairway, there’s a bath and three
bedrooms. There’s a bedroom, or office, bath and laundry room in the basement.
Original elements of the 1760 Cape-style house and the 1800 remodeling remain. One fireplace is surrounded
by a composite of horizontal and vertical panels with feathered joints that dates to 1800, and a corner cupboard may, except
for the glass doors, date to 1760. Most of the windows are 19th century; some horizontal boards in the attic are original, and
the early summer beam in incorporated in the rear wall of the hall and living room. Other beams are adze-cut antiques, there
are many wide floorboards, and the front door has an oversized wooden latch, in addition to a more modern closure.
