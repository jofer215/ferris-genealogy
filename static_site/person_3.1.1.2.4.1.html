            <div class="person-text">(3.1.1.2.4.1) SYLVANUS FERRIS born c1822 Cold Spring, Putnam, NY and died before 1880 since
he is not listed in the 1880 census; married Permelia (Amelia) (Pamella) Warren born May 1836 and
died after 1900; Sylvanus and Permelia are listed in the 1860 Census in Cold Spring - he was a
carpenter; in the 1870 Census they were in Philipstown and she is listed as Amelia; in the 1880 census
she was living in Nelsonville; in the 1900 census, she was living in Nelsonville with her son James.
From the Centennial 1870-1970 of the United Methodist Church, Cold Spring NY: Lightning struck
twice during a violent electric storm on the night of July 7, 1938. One bolt damaged steeple of the
historic North Highlands Methodist Church, while another bolt hit a flagpole on the property of Mrs.
Elizabeth Ferris in Rock Street, Cold Spring. Only the fast work of the Nelsonville and Cold Spring
Fire Departments saved the church from destruction. It was an odd coincidence that both the church
and the flagpole were struck, since the former had been erected by the late Sylvanus Ferris, Sr.,
building contractor with William LaDue, and the flagpole had been put up by his son, the late Sylvanus
W. Ferris, Jr. The pole had been brought to Cold Spring from Constitution Island many years before.
Born to them were purported nine kids; three of which are:</div>
