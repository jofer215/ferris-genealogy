            <div class="person-text">(5.1.3.3.1) SOLOMON FERRIS born 1756 [if dates are correct, his mother, Ruth, would have been
12 years old, when he born?] and died February 18, 1820; buried Old Cemetery, Stanwich CT. Listed as
a Tory in October 1779; with William Peck and Darling Whelpley, under sentence of death for treason;
on December 1, 1779, was exchanged for Ephraim Palmer, Nathaniel Palmer and Bethel Ferris.
Solomon was a &#x27;cowboy&#x27; who went to the British because he did not want to fight where they wanted
him. [From Robert A. Ferris: During the Revolutionary War the British did not often come into the
town of Stamford in much force, yet the place was almost entirely surrounded by the desolation of the
enemy and noise of battle. The battle of White Plains was only about fourteen miles distant. At
Horseneck the enemy appeared in force and attacked a small body of troops stationed at that place.
General Putnam, in his report on March 2, 1779, said &gt;I therefore directed the troops to retire and form
on a little hill a short distance from Horseneck, while I proceeded to Stamford and Greenwich to collect
the militia, and a few continental troops which were there, with which I returned immediately, and
found that the enemy, after plundering the inhabitants of a principal part of their effects, and destroying
a few salt works, and a small sloop and store, were on their return again.= The enemy&#x27;s force were
about fifteen hundred, and some accounts say they were within four miles of Stamford and Greenwich.
(excerpted from a speech given by Rev. J. W. Alvord, December 22, 1841, at the bicentennial
celebration of the founding of the town of Stamford). The October, 1779 Session of the General
Assembly sentenced Darling Whelpley, Solomon Ferris, William Peck, and David Washburn to death
for their crime of high treason. Sentence was suspended until the first Wednesday of March 1780.
Seventy-nine people signed a petition for Solomon, claiming .... That he bore the character of an
honest young lad - diligent in business &amp; of good deportment until the present war; and although he has
been guilty of an atrocious Crime against the State &amp; some of the Inhabitants of this Town have

suffered from his rash and Imprudent conduct in joining the enemy; yet considering his former good
character - his youth &amp; want of experience in Life which induce us to believe that he was enticed away;
we beg leave to intercede for him. Solomon&#x27;s own petition to the General Assembly, written from the
Litchfield jail in October 1779, claimed he was enticed to join the British. About two years ago (being
then about twenty years of Age and Under the Influence of Evil Counsellors who took advantage of his
apparent Backwardness go Serve as a Soldier) was enticed away from his Wife &amp; child and persuaded
to go to Long Island, and as one Evil leads to another so your unfortunate Petitioner Suffered himself to
be lead. Your Petitioner&#x27;s ill chosen companions taking advantage of his Penury and consequent
Gloomy State of mind urge him on to the Perpetration of crimes which shock his Mind Even at the
Recollection. Your Petitioner before he left Home would not believe he should Ever have been so lost
to a Sense of the obligations of a moral Nature he lay under as to be instrumental in bringing Distress
on his own Friends &amp; neighbors by spoiling their Goods &amp; carrying them captive. With the greatest
Humility &amp; Earnestness intreats your Honours to spare his Life however your Honours may otherwise
in your great Wisdom see fit to dispose of him, your Petitioner prays your Honours to consider his
tender age how easily inconsiderate youth is lead astray especially to the Perpetration of Crimes almost
unheard of in this Land... Thanks to the neighbor&#x27;s intercessions, Peck, Whelpley and Ferris escaped
death. On December 1, 1779, Solomon and others were exchanged as noted above. Solomon&#x27;s
property was confiscated in 1779 because of his being a Loyalist. Possibly Solomon wasn&#x27;t really a
Loyalist (Tory was the common term), he just wouldn&#x27;t fight at the time in 1779 when he was called
upon to fight. In that year he was 23 years and his wife, Levina, was only 16 or 17 years old. The
couple had a baby, Solomon, Jr., and was expecting another child, Andrew. Also, Solomon&#x27;s younger
brother, Andrew, had died a cart accident on October 18, 1778, at age 20, so probably Joseph didn&#x27;t
want his only remaining son to be fighting in 1779. Because of these circumstances it is understandable
that Solomon &quot;wouldn&#x27;t fight where they wanted him to fight&quot;.] Solomon, who escaped a death
sentence for treason in 1779, as imprisoned a second time at the end of the War. His case was taken up
in a letter from Sir Guy Carleton to Governor Trumbull written on October 15, 1783, after the Treaty of
Paris ending the war was signed. According to Carleton, Ferris joined the British Army at Lloyd&#x27;s Neck
on Long Island in 1777, and later raided Greenwich as a member of the King&#x27;s Militia Volunteers in
1779, destroying boats, stealing cattle, and taking 15 residents prisoner to New York. After the War, in
September 1785, Ferris was among the many refugees who decided to settle in Nova Scotia. When he
returned to Greenwich to retrieve his family, his father&#x27;s house was surrounded and Ferris was captured
and charged with crimes against the State. Only after the General Assembly intervened was Ferris
permitted to go to Nova Scotia. He married Levina Johnson who was baptized May 12, 1762/3 and
died January 12/13, 1834/35, Stanwich [dau of Henry and Amy (Peck) Johnson]. Solomon received
several Greenwich properties from his father in 1794, 1796, 1800, and 1804, so apparently his father
was not too terribly upset over his son&#x27;s &#x27;high treason&#x27;. Born to them were [not in order of birth]:</div>
