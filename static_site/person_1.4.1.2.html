(1.4.1.3) THOMAS FERRIS born September 2, 1757 Westchester and died North
Castle NY June 18, 1831; buried at Middle Patent Cemetery, North Castle (Armonk),
Westchester Co NY. He served during the Revolution in the New York Line; hero with
Harvey Brick in June 1780/81 (See Separate Paper on Thomas); Town Clerk 1789-91;
Member of Constitutional Convention 1801; Clerk of Westchester County 1802-08;
1810-11; 1813-15. He married June 1780 Mary Ann Banks [dau of James &amp; Ann
(Brush) Banks] born July 16, 1760 and died June 18, 1851. On February 25, 1846,
Mary Ann applied for and received Thomas&#x27;s pension (W23028); their son, Samuel B.
made an affavidit at North Castle NY that stated Thomas had served under his uncle,
Colonel Thomas Thomas and in Captain John Thomas&#x27;s Company. Thomas Ferris, son
of Martyr James, who previously escaped on the landing of the British troops at
Throgg’s Neck and joined the American forces, learned of his father’s death. Young,
active and of vigorous, powerful frame, he now became one of the deadliest and most
dangerous enemies of the invader. He was generally employed in collecting information
of the movements of the British Forces, and this duty brought him in frequent connect
with Luther Kennicut, one of the persons employed by the Commander-in-Chief to
frequent the camp of the enemy in the capacity of a spy, and who has been immortalized
in the character of Harvey Birch. Kennicut was one of the most active men thus
employed. Whenever any movement was in contemplation by the British Army, he
would adroitly manage to become possessed of all the particulars which were secretly
communicated to the American Forces. Young Ferris was one of those employed to
receive such intelligence. One of the many interviews between Ferris and Kennicut, a
bold plan was conceived by them for the surprise capture of one of the principal British
Officers who had his headquarters in the Ferris Homestead. Two other enterprising
patriots were engaged in the attempt. On the evening fixed upon, Ferris and his two
companions - Kennicut appointment to meet them on the Neck, cautiously approached
the sentinels, gradually worked past them, and soon joined Kennicut at the place of
meeting. It was arranged to make the capture at midnight of the next day, under the
leader of FERRIS, who was acquainted with the house. Kennicut then left, when Ferris
becoming thirsty, incautiously ventured to the well near the house, when he was
observed and recognized by one of the slaves belonging to the family. In a few minutes
after this incident, Kennicut came to them hurriedly and informed them that their
presence was known and that a thorough search was ordered at the first approach of
daylight. To escape as they had come was impossible. Towards the lower end of the
Back was an old stone wall which had been built double, and which was surrounded by
a thick and tangled mass of plum bushes. It was proposed to remove one side of the wall

and rebuild it in such a manner as to afford hollow placements for concealment of the
patriots. Ferris and Kennicut first built in their companions and lastly Ferris took his
place and Kennicut completed the entombment. With a few words of caution, he left
them promising to return when it was prudent. Daylight appeared and the search began.
The tramp of soldiers was heard. Nearer and nearer they came, right to the spot where
they were concealed. Two files of soldiers, one on each side of the wall. Halt and
discovery seemed certain. The trampled grass was about to betray the whereabouts of
the immured patriots. There, the D---d rebels must have lain there last night, said one,
but another was of the opinion that some deserters who had escaped the day before had
slept there. This opinion prevailed, for the soldiers tramped off on their search. All day,
and towards morning of the next, our heroes remained in the wall, without food and in a
state of uneasy anxiety until released by Kennicut. The capture of the British officer
was given up and eventually the patriots escaped from the Neck. He was more
successful on another occasion, when with some companions, in a whale boat, he
reached Stoneington and resolved to cut out a schooner belonging to the British. At the
house of Midnight they cautiously approached the schooner, but one man walked its
deck, the others being asleep below. He seemed to be unconscious of the danger which
threatened the vessel, not a sound denoted their approach, and the boat was by the
vessel’s side, and the assailants already pouring on the deck before the sentinel was
aware of the attack. A pistol at his head commanded his immediate silence and in a
moment the hatches and companionways were secured, the cables were cut and the sails
hoisted. The noise caused by the hoisting of the sails reached the batteries on shore, the
alarm was given - - but the schooner was soon out of sight and beyond reach of the
enemy.
