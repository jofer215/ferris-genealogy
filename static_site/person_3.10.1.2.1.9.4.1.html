            <div class="person-text">(3.10.1.2.1.9.4.1) CORDELIA A. DARBY (twin) born July 10, 1834 McLean, Tompkins, NY and died
January 26, 1891 Cortland Co, NY; married June 15, 1850 in McLean NY, Warren Nye [son of Oliver,
Jr. &amp; Esther (Wheeler)] born September 2, 1828 Virgil, Cortland Co and died July 07, 1902 Tompkins
Co NY. The Warren Nye family, consisting of Warren (30), Cordelia (25), Russell (7), E(A)lvena (5),
&amp; Arthur (1) was listed as living in the Cortland County Index in 1860. (Esther is apparently listed as
Alvena, apparently her middle name, since she is shown again &amp; Alvena is not, and there is no Alvena
in the cemetery listings for the family in either Cortland or McLean.) In 1865 census, Warren, Cordelia,
Esther E, Arthur E, Millard LW age 3.5, Melvin G.D. age 2.5, Freemont Grant aged 7 months are
shown. In 1870, same members again shown, but Freemont Grant is called &quot;Eddie&quot;, and on a
gravestone in 1879, we see Edwin F. has passed away at age 14 years old. I believe the listing as
Fremont Grant &amp; &quot;Eddie&quot; both refer to Edwin Fremont Grant Nye, or Edwin F. Nye as the tombstone
lists him. In 1877, Cordelia A, is listed as (w of Warren) living at 17 Clayton Ave in the city of Cortland
City Directory. Mrs. C.A. Nye is shown again (1888-89) living at 17 1/2 Clayton Ave with Lettie M.
Nye, (who would be 14-15 at that time) student, living at 16 1/2 Clayton in the City of Cortland
directory in the 1888/89 city directory. The Cortland County Historical Society Information shows
Cordelia &amp; Warren also listed as living in Virgil, South Cortland in the 1880 census in the town of
Virgil, with sons Millard, Melvin, &amp; daughter Lettie, age 5. The 1889 City Directory lists Cordelia
living with Lettie M, with Warren shown in Virgil - again separately as residence in Virgil. There is no
explanation for the listing of separate residences after 1877, since Cordelia is listed seemingly
indicating she is wife or widow of Warren. Warren is listed as living in Virgil - not dead! However, Jim
Carrington, a descendant of Warren&#x27;s brother German Millard Nye tells me &quot;In the 1920s, I believe, the
old trolley still ran between Cortland and Preble --- a convenient way to commute to work.&quot; Also, we
found an entry from the Tully Newspaper &quot;The Nye Boys are remodeling their house in the swamp.&quot;

We suspect that for some reason, the home farm might have become swampy, &amp; the Warren Nye&#x27;s
might have moved to Cortland, where Warren could commute by trolley to the farm. The 1892 State
Census for Cortland County lists Warren age 65 living in Virgil, alone (Cordelia passed away in 1891),
&amp; in 1900 he is listed as living in Virgil with Evaline. He remarried Evaline Victoria Sanford Nov 26,
1893, after Cordelia&#x27;s death. Interestingly enough, Warren is buried in the McLean Baptist Cemetery
with his sons Russell D, who died at age 8 in 1857, Emory D who died as a 1 1/2 year child in 1857, &amp;
Edwin F. who died at age 10 in 1875. His parents are buried there also. Cordelia is buried in Cortland
Rural Cemetery where her parents are buried, along with son Millard Sumner L.W. Nye, &amp; both his
wife&#x27;s Anna &amp; Stella, &amp; his daughter Jennie. Also buried in the Cortland Cemetery are Warren &amp;
Cordelia&#x27;s oldest daughter Esther Elvina Nye Johnson, widow of Wm. B. Johnson. She was survived by
brothers Millard S., Arthur E Nye of Oneonta, &amp; sister Lettie Crydenwise of Sparks, Georgia. Warren
Nye is buried in the McLean Cemetery, as are his parents. His sons Russell D. Nye, who died at age 8,
Emory Nye who died at 1 1/2, and Edwin Fremont Nye are buried with him at McLean. Cordelia, their
son Millard Sumner L.W. Nye, his 2 wives Anna &amp; Stella &amp; daughter Jenny are buried in Cortland
Rural Cemetery, as is their daughter Esther Elvina, widow of Wm. B. Johnson. Born to them were:</div>
