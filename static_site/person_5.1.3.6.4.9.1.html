            <div class="person-text">(5.1.3.6.4.9.1) CLARENCE CLARK FERRIS (Photos) born February 15, 1864 Greenwich and died

County. He was a member of the National Democratic Club of New York and maintained his residence
in Scarsdale. Along with his brother, Harry, they owned 56 acres of the original farm granted to their

ancestor and that land was leased to the Sound Beach Golf and Country Club. He married, first,

Bertha Vincent Odell (1877-1969) [dau of Edward Valentine Odell].
Presuming this is the correct fella – Brooklyn Eagle, June 12, 1902: Attorney Clarence C Ferris, who represents
several owners of property required for the new Eastern District Bridge, has written to the Bridge Commissioner Lindenthal
as follows: “You state that numbers 206 Havenmeyer street, 218, 231, 233 and 239 South Fifth street were offered to the
New East River Bridge Commission by the several owners for the various sums which you mention, and that such offers
were accepted, and that you are willing to buy all of said parcels at the prices agreed upon between the owners and the New
East River Bridge Commission. The several owners have withdrawn and rescinded, through myself as attorney, the several
offers mentioned, and have made other offers to sell to the City of New York, as contained in my letter to you. Those are the
only offers which are now in existence. I regret that you have formed the opinion that the prices which I have named in my
letter on the 3d instant are too high. I beg to call your attention to the fact that they are much more reasonable in every
instance than prices which the city has already paid for various parcels of property in the approach and plaza. Owners of
property in cases of acquisition of the same for a public purpose always feel, as they do in the case of taxation, that equality
is equity. And they wish to be treated as well as others are treated. Obviously, the only treatment which will be satisfactory
to property owners is to pay each one the same as any other has been paid when the values are substantially equal. If this is
not done the city acquires at a low rate the property of those who are needy while the wealthy are enabled to hold out for
full value. I will not consent to see any one of my clients receive any less for his property than any other person has received
for a similar property. These people for the the most part are going to be turned out of homes which represent the
accumulations of a lifetime, and which are worth much more to them in general than best prices which had been paid for
similar property. We do not expect to be allowed for the rents which have been lost for the past five years, or to have the
amount of the taxes and water rates which have been paid returned, but we do expect to receive the full market value of the
property, as established by the sales already made.”
