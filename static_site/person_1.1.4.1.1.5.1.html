DEATH CLOSES EYES OF COL J K GORE
Former Postmaster Of This City And Adjutant General Of Indiana Succumbs
LONG RESIDENT OF ELKHART
Locating Here First In 1855, He Attains Majority Here,
And After Civil War Service Becomes Manufacturer
James K Gore a citizen of Elkhart most of the years since he accompanied his parents to
this city fifty-six years ago, one of the defenders of the nation in the Civil War, former
manufacturer, an ex postmaster or Elkhart, and once Adjutant General of Indiana
succumbed at 1:15 PM this afternoon, after lying in an unconscious state since Thursday
night. The funeral service will probably be held Tuesday. Col. Gore&#x27;s demise occurred at
the home of himself and Mrs. Gore, No 308 West Marion Street. Though his health had
been declining for a year or so, he had refrained from seeking medical advice until he
was stricken with paralysis on June 13, his tongue and one side of his body being
affected. The physician who then assumed charge of the patient ascertained hat Col.
Gore was a victim of diabetes, this ailment contributing to the difficulties with which the
attendants were confronted. The death of Col. Gore removes one of the city&#x27;s best known
citizens, a man who in his prime was one of the most popular of men engaged in
building up this community&#x27;s various interests, in social, church and fraternal circles as
well as business.
FIRST COMES TO ELKHART IN 1855
Col. Gore, born in Dutchess County, NY, in 1837, was a son of Samuel C and Ruth
Ketchum Gore. Two years later his family moved to Putnam County, NY, and remained
there until 1855, Col. Gore, in the meantime, learning the pattern making trade at cold
Springs opposite West Point. In 1855 the family came to Elkhart and five years later Col.

Gore went to Mishawaka where he was employed in a furniture factory. In 1861, at the
beginning of the Civil War, he enlisted with the Sixth Michigan Volunteer Infantry. As
leader of the regimental band, going to Baltimore, then to Newport News, New Orleans,
Vicksburg, Baton Rouge and finally again to New Orleans, where he was mustered out
in 1862, the government having decided to dispense with brass bands in the army. Col.
Gore returned to Mishawaka and engaged in the manufacture of chairs but at the
expiration of thirteen months raised a company of volunteers and was commissioned its
Captain. The company was assigned to the 138th Indiana, going out for 100 days but
remaining five months, being engaged in the duty of guarding railroads in the rear of
Gen. Sherman&#x27;s army in its march through Georgia to the sea.
RETURNS HERE IN 1869
In 1865 Col. Gore went to Fond du Lac, Wis., where he was employed as foreman of the
Union Iron Works. In 1869, he returned to Elkhart, and embarked in the planing-mill and
wood working business with john Vanderlip until 1873, when Henry C Wright bought
Mr. Vanderlip&#x27;s interest and the firm of Gore &amp; Wright was formed. Two years later,
Frederick Wright bought H C Wright&#x27;s interest in the business, which suffered a serious
loss by fire in 1874.
Col. Gore served as Postmaster from 1890 to 1894, and following the election of
Governor Mount was Adjutant General of the Indiana National Guard, serving in that
office during and following the Spanish American War. After retiring from that office he
was in business in Indianapolis before returning to Elkhart. Prior to his elevation to the
Office of Adjutant General, Col. Gore had been active in the Indiana National Guard,
and was Colonel of the Third Regiment I. N. G., at the time Governor Matthews ordered
that regiment to Roby to suppress prize-fighting.
HIS SURVIVING RELATIVES
Col. Gore was married twice, his first wife, Miss Elizabeth E Field, whom he married in
1862, dying a year later. In 1866, Col. Gore married Miss Elizabeth J Ferris of
Mishawaka, who survives him. One son, Morton W Gore, born to this union died in this
city of typhoid fever soon after reaching manhood, the loss proving a heavy blow to Col.
and Mrs. Gore.

Brigadier General, is survived by his wife and the following sisters and brother: Mrs. J T
Vanderlip of San Francisco, Mrs. M U Demarest, Mrs. C A Foster and Mrs. Franc

Stevens of Elkhart, and John Gore. His mother died December 1, 1910, at the age of
ninety-five, and his father died at an advanced age August 17, 1897.
