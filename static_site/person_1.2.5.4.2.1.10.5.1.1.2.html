Ossining NY. &quot;Jo Ann&quot; attended Roosevelt school, then went to Brookside. Jo Ann was quite the
tomboy, being the only girl in a neighborhood full of boys. At the approximate age of 10, she entered a
county-wide sporting competition and won a softball distance throwing contest, beating even the boys
in her age group. She was awarded her blue ribbon by none other than Ty Cobb! Jo Ann went to Mary
Immaculate high school in Ossining, then attended D&#x27;Youville College in Buffalo, NY graduating with
a bachelor of Science with a major in nursing. Jo Ann worked as a medical and coronary care ICU
nurse at Strong Memorial hospital in Rochester, NY. She moved to Honolulu, Hawaii in 1971, and
worked as a coronary care ICU nurse at Straub Clinic and hospital in Honolulu, and in 1974 entered
pre-med at the University of Hawaii. Jo Ann graduated medical school as class president on May 18,

1980, the very day Mount St. Helen&#x27;s blew! Her internship and residency was at Columbus Children&#x27;s
Hospital and the Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio from June 1980 to 1984, where she achieved
the position of Chief Resident. Seeking winter sports, Jo Ann took a job in private practice pediatrics in
Danbury, CT. Currently she enjoys her dogs, skiing, golfing and all of her wonderful friends since, as
she believes, &quot;friends become our chosen family&quot;.</div>
