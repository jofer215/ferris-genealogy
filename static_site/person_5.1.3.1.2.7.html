            <div class="person-text">(5.1.3.1.2.7) STEPHEN GANO FERRIS born August 11, 1788 Hillsdale, Columbia, NY and died
November 29, 1876 Fountain Green (Carthage) IL; buried in the village graveyard; at the age of 4, he
accompanied his family to their removal to North Norwich, Chenango Co NY, then a frontier county
and quite sparsely settled. Here, he learned the tanner and currier’s trade and followed that business
until his father moved to Yates Co NY, probably in 1810-12. About 1820, he moved to a farm near the
town of Howard, Steuben Co NY, which was then a frontier county. Here he remained until the spring
of 1832, when he departed for Illinois, where he was one of the founders of Fountain Green, Hancock,
IL. The family, consisting of Stephen, his wife and six children, arrived in Illinois, in December, 1832
at Trader’s Point, which at that time comprised 3 or 4 log cabins; 3 or 4 traders and their families and
100 or so Indians and half-breeds. They arrived in Lick Grove (Fountain Green), December 13, 1832
where he farmed 110 acres of land and resided until 1846, when he sold his estate and made his home
with his son, in that city. In early life, he became a member of the Baptist Church and maintained that
membership until his death. He married August 11, 1814 in Chenango Co NY, Eunice Beebe born
May 12, 1788 New London CT and died September 14, 1860. Born to them were:

(5.1.3.1.2.7.1) JOHN MILTON FERRIS born 1816 Chenango Co NY; John went to Illinois with his
family 1832 and resided at home until he was 21 years of age when he began the practice of law; was
Justice of the Peace for many years and County Judge for 8 years. [Note - there was a John M. Ferris ,
of Fountain Green, appointed as a member of a committee relative to driving the Mormons out of
Nauvoo, IL - assume this is the same one.] [there is a John M. Ferris born June 10, 1816 and died
February 18, 1899 buried West Batavia Cemetery, Batavia, Kane, IL, which is quite a distance from
Fountain Green IL – probably not same guy.]; married 1852 Lavina White of Allegheny Co NY and
born to them were:</div>
