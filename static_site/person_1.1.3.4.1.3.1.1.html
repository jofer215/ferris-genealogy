Treasuring Past Shapes An Historian&#x27;s Future
An historical tour of Shrub Oak is exciting if your guide is White Plains historian
Renoda Hoffman. Her descendants settled the area, building homes on Main Street,
Stoney Street, Glen Road and James Street. Hoffman&#x27;s main ancestors, descended from
the Ferris family of Shrub Oak, started with Jeffrey Ferris who came over from England
in 1632. John James, Hoffman&#x27;s great-great grandfather, lived on the corner of Main and
Stoney streets. Hoffman is not a shrinking violet. Deep down, she&#x27;s tough and
persevering, in spite of an aura of old world gentility. &quot;I always wanted to be related to
Jesse James,&quot; she said, not disappointed that John James was thought to be
illegitimate.Her grandmother and grandfather, Elizabeth Ferris and Gustave Brown,
lived on Stoney Street and Glen Road, where they raised 13 children, including her
father, Alonzo. She noted her grandmother routinely fed the area&#x27;s legendary &quot;Leather
Man,&quot; a character dressed head to toe in leather who lived in caves around what is now
the Taconic State Parkway area. Her grandfather, Gus Brown, was an itinerant worker
who traveled around fixing watches. He&#x27;d even deliver the Sunday paper to the wealthy
summer people who lived around Lake Mahopac. In 1893, they presented a gift to Gus
Brown - tickets, hotel reservation and enough money to visit the Columbian World&#x27;s Fair
in Chicago, an event he dreamed of attending, but never thought he could. Her aunt Lena
(Helena Brown) born in a house on New Street. She married the superintendent of one
of the iron factories in Peekskill, Harry S. Gwynne, related to the Vanderbilts. Owning a
car was one thing when cars first came out, driving it was something else. Rules and
regulations for moving vehicles, including a driver&#x27;s license, were as yet unheard of
circa 1910. Hoffman&#x27;s uncle, Charlie James, forgot how to stop his brand new car,
driving it into the garage and out the rear wall. Both James and Hoffman&#x27;s father

treasured this anecdote and repeated it often. Despite his brother-in-law&#x27;s hapless
automobile incident as a young man, Hoffman&#x27;s father, Alonzo, went into the hacking or
taxi business in Peekskill. He also took a week&#x27;s job with Ajax, a strong man who was
performing at the Peekskill Theatre, putting a board across his chest, then inviting six or
seven people to stand on it. However, the main trick in the act was to keep a car from
taking off. The strong man held ropes attached to the car like reins. To keep from being
dragged off the stage, he was also tied with rope attached to a hook firmly anchored in
the stage floor. &quot;Dad would start the car, the momentum lifted the rear wheels off the
floor, spinning, wildly, but the strong man was able to hold the car,&quot; Hoffman related,
having heard the story from her father, although the event took place long before she
born. &quot;One day, my dad, hurrying to the theatre, had a flat tire. Not having time to
change the tire and still get to the theatre on time, he kept on going. He drove onto the
stage, but the trick was doomed. The rear wheels would not raise from the floor, and the
car not only wanted to go forward, it did. The car and Ajax went flying off the stage.&quot;
Born in Peekskill at their house on James Street, Renoda Brown was only 9 months old
when her father moved the family to White Plains in 1920, although she returned to
Peekskill and Shrub Oak every summer of her youth, visiting her large family. A quiet
man, but a lot of fun, Alonzo now had a steady mob working for a clothier. Who would
have dreamed that his daughter would become the historian for the City of White Plains
in 1970? Channel 34 in White Plains has begun a series of Renoda Hoffman&#x27;s historic
photographs and commentary. &quot;I like the idea of doing a television series on the
changing face of White Plains,&quot; she said. &quot;I have hundreds of photographs that people
can enjoy while learning about White Plains as it used to be.&quot; &quot;Round and About
Broadway&quot; was her first televised show, shown every Monday in December. Next, with
the date to be announced, is &quot;And Tehen Came the Galleria,&quot; recreating the City of
White Plains before it underwent a massive facelift. The Galleria opened in August,
1980, part of the urban renewal project that cost $100 million. Encouraged by the
success of her previous books, It Happened in White Plains, and Yesterday in White
Plains, she&#x27;d even consider And Then Came the Galleria as the basis for a third book.
&quot;I&#x27;m looking for an angel who has $25,000 to help publish it,&quot; Hoffman commented. The
author/historian came upon her new-found career in her later years. &quot;I was just a
housewife until 1960, happy and content with my family, never volunteering for things,&quot;
she said. However, she did take a part-time job in 1947 to help out her neighbor who
was principal of Purchase Elementary School. Working as a school secretary for a few
hours a week for many years turned out to be her life saver.Married almost 23 years to
Howard C. Hoffman, known as &quot;Pete,&quot; an engineer with the City of White Plains, she

recalled, &quot;Pete was the talker - more socially adept. Through him, we knew a lot of
people,&quot; she said. When he taught radio at night school (now kown as adult education),
she took dressmaking. &quot;We were very close; I was very shy and retiring. If I heard
someone lecture to a group, my immediate thought was, &#x27;I couldn&#x27;t do that&#x27;.&quot; Aware that
her husband was desperately ill in 1960, Hoffman revamped a viable future for
maintaining their home and educating their son. To that end, she became a full-time
school secretary at Purchase School, a job she held for 30 years, retiring in 1977. When
Pete died in 1960, Hoffman was crushed by his death, soldiering on seemed to be the
only way to assuage her grief. It was this job that led to her commitment to the history of
White Plains. In 1961, Mary Andrews, a local photographer, presented a slide lecture at
the school. Hoffman assisted by fitting slides into the projector, making sure each one
was the right one for Andrews&#x27; commentary. After working with Andrews on several
slide programs, Hoffman sensed a reawakening of her fascination for history.
Subsequently, Andrews invited her to join the Westchester County Historical Society.
Before long, Hoffman was invited to be a trustee. &quot;I didn&#x27;t know if I could do it!&quot; she
remembered, noting that Andrews told her to &quot;Take it!&quot; The Westchester County
Historical Society was run by volunteers in the &#x27;60s, albeit professionals such as doctors,
lawyers, teachers and college professors. Hoffman, who had never attended college, was
an exception. However, they took her under their wing, teaching her the rudiments of
running the county historical society and much about local history. She remembers being
terrified at giving her first report, but mustered up the courage at a full board meeting,
thanks to the encouragement of her fellow volunteers. In 1977, she became the society&#x27;s
first woman president in its 103rd year of existence, a post she held for three years, until
1980. She was asked, in 1964, to edit the society&#x27;s quarterly publication, a popular
booklet entitled, &quot;The Historian,&quot; ordered by history buffs throughout the U.S. That
meant &quot;do the whole darn thing,&quot; Hoffman recalled. However, retired Army Colonel
Louis Frohman, a local photographer and member of Westchester County Historical
Society (WCHS), offered his help. Together, they put out two editions before he laid the
project in her hands for the next 20 years. In 1984, Hoffman ended her tenure as editor
of &quot;The Historian,&quot; turning it over to younger volunteers because she was writing books,
co-founding the White Plains Historical Society and restoring the interior of
Washington&#x27;s Headquarters, known as the Purdy House, at 60 Park Avenue, White
Plains, mostly at her own expense. As editor of &quot;The Historian,&quot; Hoffman became
known to historians all over the United States for the integrity of the writing and the
little known but relevant history she unearthed, according to fellow historians
throughout Westchester County. During her stint as editor, Hoffman was appointed

historian of White Plains. Her salary for the task, to which she was appointed in 1970 by
then-Mayor Richard Hendey, was zero. She remembered Hendey as being less than
supportive, telling her upon announcement of her appointment in 1970, &quot;Now you run
along and do whatever historians do.&quot; That included paying for everything herself,
except stationery. Today she has a budget that cannot exceed $1,500. A city
administrator telephoned her just as 1990 was coming to an end. &quot;Renoda, you know
they cut back on your budget!&quot; he said. He was floored by the ire of this gentle lady who
has learned how to defend the world of local history. According to Renoda, he was taken
aback, and replied, &quot;Hold it, take it easy! Renoda, we&#x27;ll work on your budget!&quot; What
does a historian do? &quot;History is our business,&quot; said Hoffman. &quot;It&#x27;s done in different
ways. There are no rules for us.&quot; A historian does anything that would be connected to a
city&#x27;s history with a date on it, even a little memento, like an old-fashioned dance
invitation. Hoffman is a great record keeper, using acid-free paper to mount newspaper
articles, including obituaries in voluminous scrapbooks. Old newspapers like The Daily
Argus, The Daily Reporter and The Daily Record supply priceless memorabilia for her
scrapbooks, merging with current events in White Plains. Together, she said, they form a
complete history that is supplemented by hundreds, maybe thousands, of slides she has
taken of every block of the city. A card table in her living room has scissors, paste,
newspapers neatly stacked and a scrapbook ready to be filled. The wonder is that she&#x27;s
up to date and ready to clip and paste tomorrow&#x27;s news about people and events in White
Plains. About five years ago, she got permission to store her records in a small space in
the White Plains Library, including her assessment books for the village of White Plains
dating back to the 1870s. They list everybody&#x27;s name, address and what they paid in
taxes. She also rescued a lot of things from the village court, old summonses, judges&#x27;
summations or verdicts, and what the guilty had to pay. In addition, she found a huge
file in the old civilian defense building that contained legal papers from the 1860s to the
1900s, past records from the city that were never catalogued, but are now safe. Hoffman
has archives at White Plains Library and is trying to get an archivist to work on school
records that go back to the last century. They contain dates, names, and addresses that
are supplemented by high school yearbooks from 1898 to the 1930s. Hoffman has been
able to write two books, hold the office of president of the Westchester County
Historical Society and edit its publication &quot;The Historian,&quot; and co-found the White
Plains Historical Society while holding the office of White Plains historian. Proceeds
from the sale of Yesterday in White Plains and It Happened in White Plains are donated
to the historic Jacob Purdy House, owned by the City of White Plains. As vice-president
of the White Plains Historical Society since 1984, Hoffman immediately put the

complete restoration of the Purdy House on her agenda, regardless of the expense. Last
year, General Washington&#x27;s headquarters (1776 and 1778) at 60 Park Avenue, known as
the Purdy House, was finally restored at a cost of more than $100,000 with $47,000
toward the restoration of the interior from the sale of Hoffman&#x27;s first book, Yesterday in
White Plains, and an additional $25,000 from IBM. The City of White Plains paid for
the exterior restoration. Hoffman&#x27;s books are sold at White Plains Public Library, but
word-of-mouth creates an astounding number of sales. Book stores take 40% of all sales,
while Hoffman&#x27;s method assures that 100% of the proceeds from her book sales will go
toward the estoration of Purdy House. Hoffman, it seems, cannot be filed and
categorized like historical minutia - she&#x27;s always looking toward tomorrow to learn
something about yesterday. Source: Kathy Grantham, North County News, January 16 22, 1991
Dear Mr. Bailey, I recently had the wonderful opportunity to attend the funeral services
of Renoda Hoffman in the most appropriate setting in White Plains, the historical Rural
Cemetery. Surrounded by her family and all that loved her and respected her. It was nice
of you to remember Renoda Hoffman and write an article about her on your Website as
well as mention her today January 14, 2005 on your White Plains television show. You
ask for suggestions in terms of what would be appropriate to name after her or to name a
site after her in White Plains to commemorate Renoda Hoffman’s great historical
contributions she herself has made to White Plains over her long illustrious life. How
about for starters just remembering her and her great work and contributions she
unconditionally gave to White Plains. White Plains indeed should remember her, honor
her, respect her and create her memorial here in White Plains. An original memorial, a
historical memorial and one her own. Despite the fact that I came to know her for a very
short period of time back in 2003 through the White Plains Historical Society and Mr.
Jack Harington at Purdy House, she is one remarkable individual that forever will be
remembered and never forgotten. She left behind a living legacy, a body of work that
embodied her and all that she touched. Let us all remember that as we move through the
passage of time and change never to return she gave us the passage of time and change
through her incredible vision to live through the change and preserve that historical
change for each and every generation to come in time. Renoda Hoffman had a vision, a
vision through an image, and image through a photograph a photograph through the
passage of history. The history she lived, the history of White Plains. The History of
Renoda Hoffman is White Plains. So the most appropriate place to name after Renoda
Hoffman would have to be original unique and one of a kind. That name should be to
name Renoda Hoffman Mrs. White Plains, a place she loved, a placed she preserved,

and a place she lived in and passed in. Mrs. White Plains will forever live on as the
legacy she so deservedly is honored for. A real special person in the hearts of all she
touched. In Memory of Renoda Hoffman, Mrs. White Plains, you will always be
remembered never forgotten.
Love,
Carl Albanese &amp; Family

Renoda Hoffman
Historian and Expert on White Plains
The way Renoda Hoffman saw it, the United States as we know it today all came down
to the Battle of White Plains. &quot;If we had lost in White Plains, if the British Army had
managed to overrun Washington, what would have happened?&quot; she asked during a reenactment of the Revolutionary War battle in the fall of 2001, on its 225th anniversary.
&quot;We would have been under British rule.&quot; Skip to next paragraphThere was little Ms.
Hoffman didn&#x27;t know about White Plains history. She was the White Plains city historian
for nearly 30 years. She wrote three books on the city: &quot;It Happened in Old White
Plains,&quot; &quot;The Changing Face of White Plains&quot; and &quot;Yesterday in Old White Plains: A
Picture History of a Vanished Era.&quot; All were published by the White Plains Historical
Society. The picture history included photos of Main Street from 1887 and the White
Plains Hotel, which was razed in 1907. &quot;Like a frontier town, the street is dirt and there
are hitching posts and horse blocks,&quot; reads one caption. Ms. Hoffman fought hard for
historical preservation. She was instrumental in saving the Jacob Purdy House, for
instance. In an article published in the Westchester Historical Society Bulletin, Ms.
Hoffman asserted that the Purdy House had been used as George Washington&#x27;s
headquarters in 1776. At the time, not everyone agreed. The White Plains chapter of the
Daughters of the American Revolution believed Washington&#x27;s headquarters had been in a
small frame house on Virginia Road in North White Plains. After years of painstaking
research and some controversy, historians in both camps agreed that it was likely that
both homes had been used as headquarters. Feisty, not quick to back down and known
for her sense of humor, Ms. Hoffman would show frustration when she sensed people
did not fully appreciate the rich history of White Plains, said John Harrington, trustee of
the historical society. But she never let up on her efforts, insisting that any profits from
her books benefit the society. She was born in Peekskill, but her family moved to White
Plains in 1909 when she was 6 months old; she lived there the rest of her life. She led an

unsuccessful effort to keep the old White Plains courthouse from being razed to make
way for the Galleria mall. She was also the first female president of the Westchester
Historical Society and edited the society&#x27;s magazine for 20 years. Renoda Hoffman died
Jan. 6 at 95.
Born October 5, 1909, Renoda came to White Plains at nine months of age. Renoda
Brown Hoffman’s ancestral tree is representative of Who’s Who in Colonial
America...on her father’s side her family goes back to Jeffrey Ferris who came to
America in 1632/33, and on her mother’s side, one uncle Thurston Horn sailed with
William Kidd, venturing out of New York City Harbor in 1692 never to return. In fact,
Jacob Purdy’s great granddaughter married Renoda’s ancestor James M. Ferris and they
lived in the Purdy House.
Renoda grew up in a time of innocence when children skipped and laughed their way to
the Ranch House on Saturday afternoons, free from the fears that plague us today, and
whiled away the hours watching Tom Mix defeat villains and rescue maidens. Coming
from a family that saw Black Tuesday and the long, sad years of the Great Depression,
Renoda’s dreams of archaeological digs in far away deserts, succumbed to the reality of
Hake’s Business School where, like other young women of the day, she studied typing
and shorthand to become a secretary. Upon completing school, Renoda went to work for
two attorneys, Monday through Saturday, for $10.00 week.
It was during these years that she met Howard C. Hoffman who worked for the City of
White Plains. They were married in 1937 and had a son Richard. When her son was
school aged, Renoda was encouraged by a friend to lend a helping hand a few mornings
a week at the Purchase School. Mornings, turned to days, followed by years, and in
1979, she retired from the Purchase School, with 33 years of service. During that period,
she was introduced to the Westchester Historical Society and soon became a very active
member, serving as it’s first woman President for three years. She served as the Editor of
their quarterly publication, &quot;The Westchester Historian&quot;, for 20 years. All of her life,
Renoda embraced history. First she studied the Civil War, and then later the
Revolutionary Period. It was during that time that she discovered the wealth of history to
be found in Westchester, and particularly in White Plains. It was during these years that
Mayor Richard Hendey asked Renoda to take over the reins as White Plains City
Historian. She often quoted Mayor Hendey when telling how she became Historian
explaining that he told her that she should &quot;...just go out and do whatever Historians do.&quot;
It was with this charge that she began to amass the enormously rich and varied
collection of artifacts, documents and photographs which would eventually become the

foundation of the White Plains City Archives. Probably the most significant acquisition
she made was an original map drawn by a soldier in 1776 during the Battle of White
Plains.
Renoda was one of the founding members of the Battle of White Plains Monument
Committee, which later became the White Plains Historical Society. She was also one of
the key players in the movement to save the 1720 Jacob Purdy House from demolition
during the Urban Renewal period. She was honored by the White Plains Historical
Society with their first presentation of the Citizen Extraordinaire Award and by the
Westchester County Historical Society with their Tomahawk Award.
During her time as Historian, Renoda Hoffman authored and published three books:
&quot;Yesterday In White Plains&quot;, &quot;It Happened In Old White Plains&quot;, and &quot;The Changing
Face of White Plains.&quot; She also authored three booklets, &quot;Historic Highlights of
Westchester,&quot; &quot;Throw Back&quot; and &quot;The Battle of White Plains.&quot; All monies generated
from the books support the Jacob Purdy House and the Mission of the White Plains
Historical Society.
From the moment that Mayor Hendey sent her forth with the charge of &quot;doing whatever
Historians do,&quot; Renoda never once looked back. The City of White Plains can never in
words thank her for her unflagging spirit and depth of understanding of the importance
of preserving history for future generations. Thanks can only come in the concrete form
of continued commitment to conserving her legacy for future generations and continuing
her charge to preserve the past, and capture the present for the future. Today we do not
mourn her passing, but pay tribute not just to her 35 years as Historian, but we
pay tribute to the purity of her spirit, and the depth of her understanding, that &quot;Past is
Prologue.&quot;
But Renoda was ever so much more to the City than Historian...she was artist,
preservationist, collector, activist and photographer. She took thousands of photos and
slides of White Plans as it changed and grew through the decades. As time passes, her
work becomes more and more valuable for capturing moments in time as a legacy for
future generations. Over time she compiled a rich and varied array of historically
significant materials, accomplished almost entirely through donations from concerned
individuals and organizations. She also worked tirelessly to obtain a permanent place to
house all these wonderful glimpses of past history, and succeeded in establishing the
White Plains City Archives, now permanently named in her honor.

Renoda never did small things in a great way, but rather has done great things for our
City and it&#x27;s citizens, past, present and future. When asked once how she saw her work
she stated, &quot;.....nourished by those who have gone on before, we have fallen heir to the
precious liberty won at such a terrible price. This, along with our great nation, was
bequeathed to you and to me, to all Americans. This is our heritage.&quot;
