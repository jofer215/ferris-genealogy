            <div class="person-text">(1.1.3.12.1.3.3) FERRIS JACOBS MEIGS born February 5, 1868 Jersey City, Hudson,
NJ and died May 9, 1943 at his residence in Daytona Beach FL; he received his
preparatory education at the Dwight School for Boys in NYC, then earned his B.S. at
Yale U, 1889; his summers during college were spent at his father’s mill and woods
learning the business; after leaving college he joined his father in the development of
large lumber tracts in the Adirondacks near Tupper Lake, and later became a factor in
the introduction of scientific forestry in the Adirondack region. He succeeded his father
as president of the Santa Clare Lumber Co, 1911, holding the office until the company

quit business 1941. The company was his love and life-time occupation under; under the
direction of Meigs it became a leader in the conservation of timber in the Adirondacks
and it was complimented publicly by state forestry officials for work done in tree
nursery and planting; for years at least one tree was planted for every tree cut. Success in
the lumbering operations involved the application of scientific principles in cutting and
hauling logs and in modifying the mill operations to suit the changing character of the
logs. The company deviced methods which departed radically from the conventional
procedure [then customarily used’ where the trees are larger and transportation easier. It
was the first company to prepare and sell processed pulpwood for paper manufacture.
He was a charter member of the Empire State Foret Products Association; a trustee of
Bethune-Cookman College in Daytona Beach FL; and a director of the Lawrence
Hospital in Bronxville. A Republican in politics, he was a delegate to the NY State
Constitution Convention in 1916. Meigs was a member of the Dutch Reformed Church
of Bronxville, the Yale Club of NY and, for 40y, the Mendelssohn Glee Club; married
April 28, 1897 Louise Adele Lawrence [dau of Willian Van Duzer &amp; Sarah Elizabeth
(Bates) Lawrence] born February 25, 1871 and died August 19, 1965; buried Delhi NY;
Vassar 1891; much of the info above is from Rick Meigs; and born to them were:</div>
