            <div class="person-text">(5.1.3.6.4.5) STEPHEN KIMBERLY FERRIS (Photographs) born March 28, 1820 and died
February (August) 12, 1905 Greenwich; buried 1st Congregational Church Cemetery, Greenwich; a
colporteur or distributor of religious tracts and for years, he traveled by horseback, about the country,
his tracts in his saddlebags and he was a well-known figure in the early church history of the

died January 7, 1855; and 2d December 24, 1856 Adeline Hopkins Ferris (5.1.3.2.1.3.1).
From The First Three Hundred Years The History of The First Congregational Church of Greenwich,
Connecticut
Late in the year 1850, the Reverend Bissell noted, “Stephen Kimberly Ferris, having been duly elected a deacon
in this church and having accepted the office, was regularly ordained by prayer and the laying on of hands.
Deacon Kim, as he was affectionately called, was to serve the church for sixty years.
How much of the following story has been improved with each generation’s retelling is hard to say, but
as the illustration of Joe Dixon proves, it is based on fact. The Deacon’s reputation as a “walking Bible” is also
borne out by newspapers and records of the time.
Joe Dixon was an essence peddler who tramped the streets of Old Greenwich. These were the days when
housewives welcomed peddlers whose glib tongues were a relief from the everyday monotony of village life. Joe
Dixon had the gift of gab and prided himself on being a “free thinker.” His pet target was the church and church
people, and it can be presumed he was particularly amusing on this subject. One day, feeling pretty cocky, he
challenged the Senior Deacon to a debate. “Resolved: that the Sacred Scriptures, so-called, are not inspired.”
Now it so happened that Stephen Kimberly Ferris was the Senior Deacon, and while he was a bowlegged, funny-looking little man, he had a prodigious memory. His familiarity with scriptures had begun at an
early age. His deep respect for the church had earned him a place on the deacon’s bench before he was married.
He accepted the peddler’s challenge.
The news of the evening’s entertainment spread life wildfire, and the entire village gathered to see the
fun. That night the Deacon milked his cows a little earlier, changed into his best pants and put on a clean shirt
front. The old man ambled over to the schoolhouse and greeted the packed house smilingly because he enjoyed
debating. He lumbered to the platform and sat down. Up jumped his opponent and began a merciless barrage at
the old man. According to the reports of those who were present, the peddler was brilliant, articulate and
persistent but each argument, each point was withered by the old man’s apt quotations from the Scriptures.
Very soon the braggart was winded, the scale was tipped and a shout went up, “The old man has it. The
old man has it.”
