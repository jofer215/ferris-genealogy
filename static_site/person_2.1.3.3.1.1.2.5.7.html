            <div class="person-text">(2.1.3.3.1.1.2.5.7) CHARLES WRIGHT FERRIS born July 3, 1858 Milton WI (Johnstown NY) and
died St. Louis MO; married Kate H. Smith born NYC – 1 of 3 wives; Charles lived in Cuba for a
number of years with his son Willard.
Milton WI, August 19, 1934 – ‘To be members and friends of The Milton Congregational Church, together with relatives of
the Ferris family gathered: The pleasant duty of acting as historian on this memorable occasion has been assigned to me,
and because it has to do with the early history of own dear father and mother, William P. and Betsy Janes Ferris, it is a very
real pleasure indeed. And by reason of the fact that it has to do also with my early boyhood days spent in Rock County, I am
not interested in it than would be the case otherwise. In about the year 1830, 100 years ago, there came a very study young
man from the state of Connecticut by the name of William P. Ferris, to settle as an early pioneer in Johnstown, Rock County,
WI. Early history has it that he was a man of small means and worked his way on the Erie Canal and otherwise, and by
walking part way he reached his destination, with the determination to make a home for himself in the Middle West.
Government land was then selling for $1.25 an acre. But without money, he could not hope to acquire it even _at that small
price. And so he set about to earn his own living splitting rails and by doing other work of various sorts he got ahead enough
in the three years that followed, to buy a farm of perhaps 160 acres -- thus getting his start in the world. By that time there
was in the same neighborhood of Rock County a family by the name of Janes from the state of New York. And this young
man soon found himself a wife, a member of this family in the person of Betsey Ann Janes, a beautiful young woman it was
said. And thus the family of :Mr. and Mrs. William P. Ferris was started in the year 1842; Connecticut and New York joining
hands. From that time on children were born to this union until they totaled nine. One died in early life, leaving these eight
to grow up to mature years: Augusta, Hiram, Ellen, Mary, William, Charles, Charlotte, and Bessie. My father and mother
were religious people and the family altar was early established with the reading of the Bible each day and prayer in the
home. Church was attended faithfully each Sunday.. All this early training had its effect on each and everyone of the
children as would naturally be the case, even though sometimes we rode to church in a lumber wagon. During these years a
wonderful friendship existed among the various Janes families that had been established in that neighborhood also, not only

because of relationship by marriage, but because of the fine Christian character of these wonderful people (My mother&#x27;s
brothers).
During the years that these young people of both the Ferris and Janes families were growing up in this Johnstown
neighborhood, there developed among other qualities considerable musical ability. Among these cousins, conspicuous
musically was my sister Augusta. As a soprano singer she had no equal in .that section. And being father and mother&#x27;s first
born, she was their pride and joy and gave them great pleasure and satisfaction in the music of her beautiful voice. One
cousin in particular, Oscar Janes, was something of her equal as a bass singer. Others might be mentioned. In these early
days good music was much more scarce than in the days in which we are now living. These young people were often heard
in church and schoolhouse, and in neighborhood entertainments called &quot;Old Folks Concerts&quot; in and about what was then
known as Johnstown Center. Young in life, Augusta married to Noyes. S. Belknap of Illinois, became the mother of three
fine children, Giles, Lewis and Charlotte Belknap.. Sad to relate, she passed away in 1872, aged 29 years. Chiefly because
of better educational advantages afforded by Milton College for his children, my father sold the farm in Johnstown in about
the year 1860 and bought one of about 100 acres one mile east of Milton and moved his family into what was known as the
Walker neighborhood. Being only one mile_way from Milton College and it very convenient for various members of the
family to seek an education in this very reputable place of learning. My father also became very much interested in the
graded school in Milton, and was for some time a member of the school board, taking a lively interest in the matter of
erecting the new school, which still stands in the park in the center of town. He also took a hand in setting out the beautiful
trees that now adorn this self same park, all of which seems very familiar to me as I come back to Milton after many long
years of absence. Let me say in passing, that my parents were members of the Baptist church in Johnstown before coming to
Milton. Much might be said about the real pleasure we as a family of young children, boys and girls together, experienced
while growing up on the farm here in Milton. When old enough, we were taught to work, for there was plenty to be done the
year &#x27;round. Naturally as boys we liked to play pretty well, too, and usually found time for that also. There was the stock to
be taken care of - cows to be milked, horses fed, pigs, sheep, and chickens also, and oh what fun it was to gather the eggs
several times a day -- all of which comes back to me forcibly now. And then -- there were planting of the crops in the
Spring, harvesting time in Summer - and gathering-in the grain in the Fall. Apples for cider, pumpkins, squash, and other
vegetables to be put in the cellar for winter use. What fun it all was! As for the boys, they never liked to get up early in the
morning. However, father did like to, at about five o&#x27;clock, and there was no peace for the rest of us after that, even to the
putting on of &quot;Dingbats&quot; as he called them -- honest to good ness spankings if the boys were not up on time, ready for the
day&#x27;s work. Then there were the good things to eat, especially when company came -- grandchildren often in the later years,
I well remember. And, so much else I cannot take time to mention. Life on the Farm I&#x27;ve never been weaned from it yet.
And how I liked to ride horseback and all that. After the death of our dear mother in the year 1864, father married again in
due time. This stepmother, bringing one son with her, made a most wonderful mother and helpmate in the Ferris family, for
there were still children of tender years to be taken care of, together with cares of a household to oversee. . Too much credit
cannot be given her for the faithfulness shown in those years, especially in times of illness when father had severe attacks of
inflammatory rheumatism. Amidst of these years to which I have referred, my older sister, Ellen was married to George
Walker of the Timothy Walker family. This wedding was certainly unusual, for on Sunday evening, January 31st, these two
young people, sitting. in the choir, left their seats and the marriage ceremony was performed then and there by the minister
of the church, much to the amazement of the people of the congregation, who had been taken so much by surprise. This was
of novel origin and less trouble than some weddings. This happy couple was privileged to live together for 62 years before
George Walker passed away four years ago, a very useful and happy life indeed, and unusual in length of years. One son
born to this union, George Albert Walker. The marriage of these young people established more firmly than before a most
wonderful and friendly feeling and high regard between the Ferris and Walker families (our nearest neighbors) several in
number. So well acquainted were we with the Walkers that when speaking of them as neighbors and friends it was always
&quot;Uncle Willian&quot;, &quot;Uncle Alfred&quot;, &quot;Uncle Timothy&quot;, &quot;Uncle Moses&quot;, and &quot;Uncle Aaron&quot;. My brother Hiram found himself a
wife in Milton also, in the person of Miss Hattie Sanborn, a woman of rare ability as a teacher, and afterwards a fine
minister&#x27;s wife and mother of their five children, Semour, Sarah, Annie, Walter, and Charles Ferris. This brother Hirman
passed away in 1912. My sister Mary married Mr. C. M. Gates whose family at one time lived in Milton but had formerly
lived in Berlin, Wis., a very successful teacher in the schools there. This sister Mary passed away in 1913. I can think of
another brother in the midst of this reminiscence. William by name or Will for short, who almost married a Milton girl, but
being of a fickle nature it was hard for him to choose between three fair young ladies he had on the string at once. So it
finally fell to one of rare musical ability from New York state,. Miss Carrie M. Hakes, at one time a teacher of music in

Milton College, who is present with us today, Mrs. W. L. Ferris now living in Lakewood, a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio, with
her daughter Margaret [Fletcher]. My brother passed away in 1910 much to our sorrow. In this family there were four
children, three fine stalwart sons and one daughter, Harlo, Paul, Harry, and Margaret Ferris, all of whom are attending this
reunion today. Margaret and her two boys came all the way from Cleveland to be present here today. Our father passed
away in about the year 1879 and the stepmother I referred to outlived him quite a number of years, marrying the third time a
Mr. Cook of Whitewater where they lived very happily together several years thereafter. The farm home having been broken
up in 1880, those who were left and unmarried went to Saint Paul, Minnesota to live with Mr. and Mrs. George Walker. And
Aunt Ellen, as she is familiarly called, has, been like a mother to many of us ever since. I myself found a wife in the next
four years in the person of Miss Kate H. Smith, the mother of our two children, Willard and Florence Ferris, both of whom
might have been here today but for the fact that they are now on vacation trip touring the New England states together. I
have yet to record the marriage of the two youngest of our family, Charlotte and Bessie, the first of whom, Charlotte,
became the Wife of Mr. Arthur C. Anderson in St. Paul, a successful and prosperous banker end businessman in that city,
and parents of two boys, Frank and William Anderson, the latter having the name of his grandfather before him, whom we
honor here today,
Sad to relate, these two boys were left orphans early in life after the death of both mother and father a few years apart, and
as might be expected, their Aunt Ellen came to their rescue and mothered them for quite some time, Charlotte having passed
away in 1888, aged 26. Letters have been received expressing regret that the Andersons could not be present here today
because of previous engagements made earlier in the season, for which we are sorry indeed. Last but not least, also youngest
and smallest in stature of our family, our sister Bessie, took unto herself a husband in the person of Mr. E. F. Kimball,
formerly of Berlin, this state, and became the mother of four fine children, Richard, Robert, Charlotte, and Ferris Kimball.
This dear sister was left a widow early in life, her home being in Kansas City, Kansas. She has served wonderfully well as
both father and mother to these four children all of these years, and has come all the way from Kansas City to be present
here today. It was thought best for lack of time in this historical sketch not to go farther into detail of more than the first and
second generation. Although much might be written of the third and fourth generation, now much in evidence, I am making
one exception because of outstanding achievement by one of the great grand-children, Charlotte Belknap Reynolds,
daughter of Giles and Lula Belknap, who has for many years been a missionary in China, and the letter from which I quote
becomes a part of this sketch as follows: &quot;Charlotte and Paul Reynolds went out under the American Board in 1921 to
Fenchow (Pronounced fun-jo) China. They will soon be closing their second term and are to return for a third term.
Charlotte has helped in very many ways in the mission work, has taught Domestic Science and written a textbook on that
subject in Chinese. She manages the music program for church and schools, and has a school in her own home for her own
children and some of the children of the other missionaries. Dr. Paul Reynolds is assistant to the Chinese Principal of the
Ming I School (a large school for Chinese boys and girls of High School age), all Chinese schools, now by law having
native Principals. &quot;Paul is also Director of a large Civic Center work which last year celebrated its tenth anniversary, and at
that time was taken over by the national Y.M.C.A. He was elected head of the Religious Educational Work of all north
China.&quot; Charlotte and Paul have three children. They plan to come home in 1935 for their second furlough. The success of
this service and family reunion being held here today is due in great measure to the untiring efforts of the three stalwart sons
of my brother&#x27;s family whom I have already referred to, Harlo, Paul, and Harry Ferris, all residents of our fair state of
Wisconsin. I think I am safe in saying that no family in the state can duplicate these three for size and number of feet in
height or weight avoirdupois, and I am going to ask the to step forward on the platform while we give them a vote of thanks.
And so ends the sketch prepared by your historian for this wonderful occasion, which I hope, has been of some benefit to
those who have listened.
