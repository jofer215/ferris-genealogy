            <div class="person-text">(5.1.2.6.5.1.5) GEORGE WASHINGTON FERRIS (Photograph) born December 9, 1835/36 on West
Morris Street in the Village of Bath, Steuben, NY and died November 21/24, 1923 at his daughter&#x27;s
home in Bath; married March 8, 1856 in Steuben Co, Sarah Mowers born July 14, 1837 Steuben Co
and died October 2, 1921, Bath [sister to the above Mower girls]; both buried there Nondaga Cemetery.
George always lived in or near Bath except for two years in Ohio and nine months in the Civil War
having been in at the end. (Enlisted as a Private, 189th NY Regt October 5, 1864, promoted to
Corporal.) George was a farmer in the town of Wheeler, where he was one of the founders of the
Harrisburg Hollow Methodist Episcopal church. He has been a staunch Christian man as far back as
any of his living friends can remember, which is more than 60 years. He was always at church and
prayer meeting if able to attend, and was one of the type of home Christians who maintained the family
altar and believed the church needed the cooperation of the home to realize the best results for the
children. He was a member of the Centenary Methodist Episcopal Church of Bath since June 1911&quot;.
[George&#x27;s obituary contains information, which conflicts with the below: it says 2 children were born to
him and Sarah, Charles and Mrs. Leroy (Elizabeth) Keeler. According to info provided by descendants
there were 5 kids born to them, three of which survived their Dad.][Sarah&#x27;s obit also lists her daughter
as Mrs. Leroy (Elizabeth) Keeler of Bath.] [maybe this verifies that some of the kids credited to
George’s brother Benjamin, above, are in fact offspring of George] Born to them were:</div>
