            <div class="person-text">(3.10.1.2.1.8.4.3) JULIA M. PECK born May 9, 1840 Owego NY; educated at the Female Seminary,
Troy NY; married December 24, 1862 at the First Baptist Church of Owego NY, George A. Madill, a
lawyer, of Owego NY; they moved three or four years afterwards from Owego to St. Louis MO, where
her husband soon became a prominent lawyer/railroad attorney; believe this is same guy who the
community of Madill, Marshall, OK is named for; and born to them were:
A confusing entry here: New York Times, April 16, 1912: St Louis, Mo, April 15—Among the St. Louis
folk on the Titanic were Mrs. Edward Robert of 140 Lindell Avenue, her daughter, Miss Georgette A.
Madill, and her niece, Miss Elizabeth Allen. Mrs. Robert was formerly the wife of Judge George A.

Madill. Miss Madill, although but 15 years old, receives an annual allowance of $7,500 for clothes and
spending money by order of the Probate Court. Miss Allen is the daughter of the late George Allen and
went to Europe in January 1911. If this is the same George A Madill, apparently Julia and he divorced,
but Georgette must have been born when Julia was about 57y – doubt it! Maybe Georgette was the dau
of the below George Alexander Madill? From
The Bench and Bar of Missori Cities: George A Madill is a nativeof New York, and passed his early life at Utica, in that
state, receiving a liberal education. He pursued a course of legal studies in the Albany Law School, was admitted to the bar,
and in 1866, removing to Saint Louis, entered upon a professional career, which has in every sense proved eminently
successful. In 1870, at the urgent request of his professional brethren, who, irrespective of political preferences, petitioned
him, he accepted an election to the judgeship of the Saint Louis circuit, and continued on the bench until 1875, when he
resumed his practice as a member of the law firm of Krum and Madill. He afterward retired from his firm, and at present
(1884) conducts his business in his own name. He is also a member of the faculty of the Saint Louis Law School, his special
branch of teaching being the law of real property. As a lawyer, Judge Madill is at once thorough, scholarly, careful,
conscientious and successful. Possessing a legal mind of high order, clear, comprehensive and practical, and at the same
time being a man of fine executive ability, well versed in the intricacies of business and commercial affairs, and cool and
deliberate in his judgments, his legal opinions carry with them a weight and authority that never fail to command the highest
respect. Among his professional associates he is most highly esteemed for his manly and lawyer-like qualities. His conduct
of cases in court is marked by discretion, cleverness and precision, and in his arguments before court or jury he is
methodical, business-like and persuasive, never failing to impress his auditors with the sincereity of his convictions, and
always ready to support his legal propositios with the highest authorities. Such qualities, in an eminent degree, fitted him for
the honorable and responsible office of judge, and to them must be attributed the success which attended him to that
position. The business of his court was dispatched with promptness and accuracy, and justice was administered intelligently,
and according to law. His marvelous memory of adjudicated cases, and his methodically arranged knowledge and critical
analysis enabled him to discriminated and at an instant detect false analogies. Such was the working of his court that it was
a pleasure for a lawyer who knew his case, to appear before him. To young men he was always indulgent, and cheerfully
aided them with his counsels. At the same time he had no favorites, and no one ever accused him of discourteous treatment.
Upon his retirement from the bench he was tendered a banquet by the members of the Saint Louis bar, who there gave
expression to their regard for him in encomiums of praise. Jim – presume this is the same guy. 2007 – there is a George A
Madill Professorship at the Washington University in Saint Louise</div>
