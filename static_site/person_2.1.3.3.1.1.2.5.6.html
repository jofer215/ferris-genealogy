            <div class="person-text">(2.1.3.3.1.1.2.5.6) WILLIAM LEWIS FERRIS (Will) born September 5, 1856 Johnstown, Rock, WI
and died March 14, 1910 Portland, Jay, IN; married June 30, 1885 in Hornellsville NY, Carrie Minerva
Hakes [dau of Harlo &amp; Mary (Chandler) Hakes] born August 23, 1859 Hornellsville/Hornell, Steuben,
NY and died September 22, 1947 Lakewood OH; both buried Green Park Cemetery, Portland IN.
William was a good writer of poetry and letter. He had a smooth way with words; especially with his
girlfriends and wife Carrie. He met Carrie when he was a student at Milton College and she was a

music instructor there, he was taking vocal lessons from her. When he was lonely he wrote beautiful
letters to Carrie before and after they were married. He was an excellent singer, loved to recite
Shakespeare even in later years when, much to the embarrassment of his children, would come to
school and give recitations. He loved to play baseball, he caught with no glove and as a result injuried
his fingertips and had to stop earlier than he wished to, so he switched to pitching. Later, he bought the
town team of Portland their uniforms on the condition that they not play baseball on Sundays. Will had
a thriving egg-packing business in Milton WI. During that time, fresh eggs were not readily available
during the harsh Midwestern winters. ‘Ferris bought eggs from the farmers when eggs were plentiful
and cheap, pickled them in brine to be marketed in the fall and winter, when supply and demand
conditions were reversed.’ The egg business was to be expanded by a branch in the Peoria IL area by
his brother-in-law Charles M. Gates. Enroute to select a site, Gates met up with Mr. Matt Corcoran and
Gates had the brainstorm for the beginnings of the Creamery Package Manufacturing Company
(CPMC). On January 12, 1883, an Illinois charter was granted to Charles M. Gates, William L. Ferris,
Hiram J. Ferris, and Edward Kimball for the Creamer Package Company and that place of business was
White Rock IL. Will is credited with naming the company. The object was ‘The manufacturer and sale
of butter tubs, cheese boxes, and cooperage.’ One of the original founders of the CPMC, he was
Secretary and Superintendent of the Rock Falls IL plant by 1884. The company sold wholesale supplies
to creameries and stores, things like testing equipment and dairy cooperage supplies. Will later headed
up the Portland IN branch, 1891 until he retired early in 1910. Butter tubs were manufactured for
several years even after his early death in 1910 (Cerebral Hemorrhage). Some of his sons worked at
that plant part time as well. The business remained in the hands of various family members until after
WWII. The plant still exists today (2004) in Portland on the corner of Ash Street and the railroad. It is
now an O Cedar broom manufacturing plant. William seemed to have caught the bug of the early
automobile. He had a personal connection with Elwood Haynes of the Haynes Automobile fame in
Portland and Kokomo IN. Photos exist that show him in a 1904 Haynes car and he was driving James
Whitcomb Riley, the Indiana poet. There is another photo that shows him in front of his Arch Street
home with a 1907 Haynes touring car. He would remove the windshields from the cars – ‘because, I
don’t want to pay all that money and not feel the wind!’ The home on Arch Street has been refurbished
and the current occupant has graciously provided a copy – see photo – thanks to Mike Szakaly; Carrie
was an accomplished soloist and pianist. She trained as a concert soloist under William Hall Sherwood
at the New England Conservatory of Music. She would later play both the piano and organ for family,
community and church functions. Carrie taught vocal music at Fairbough MN Girls School; and Milton
College. Before and after William died, she taught piano in Portland IN. Born to them were:</div>
