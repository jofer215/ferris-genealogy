            <div class="person-text">(1.1.4.4.1.3) ELIZA LAFORGE born August 12, 1816 probably in Putnam or Dutchess
Co NY and died January 5, 1904, at the home of her daughter, Annice, in Barron,
Barron, WI; buried there beside her husband in the Simon Christeson family plot,
Wayside Cemetery (photo); married c1841 possibly in Wayne Co NY, Laurin Gansworth
Moffat [son of William](of Scottish descent) born April 2, 1813 near Schenectedy NY
and died March 17, 1895 Barron WI. It is said within the family, that Eliza rode on the
first train in the Hudson Valley when she was about 15 or 16 years of age. When she and
Laurin moved to Wisconsin, in about 1847, they came by way of the Erie Canal to
Buffalo NY, and then by train to Chicago IL. From there, they went by ox team to
Milwaukee and Sullivan, Jefferson County WI territory. Eliza remembered it as a
wonderful place that would grow anything. However, the land was swampy and Laurin
was ill with malaria much of the time. Their children, William and Laurin died there, so
they decided to move farther north to Necedah, Juneau County where Eliza’s father
owned 40 acres of land on the shore of the Wisconsin River. Here their daughter Amelia
died while Eliza was pregnant with her last child. Eliza’s last child, Anise was born
when Eliza was 46 years of age. While living in Necedah, Laurin was laid up for quite a
while when hurt by a falling tree. Eliza was described as having little humor and
believed in work and duty. She had curly hair and said that her mother, Margaret, had
the most beautiful hair she had ever seen. She was the community doctor in the pioneer
days, setting bones, delivering babies, handling any ailment or injury that came her way.
After a time they settled in Dallas, Barron County WI. Additional information on this
couple is available in the work by John Joseph Christeson. Born to them were:</div>
