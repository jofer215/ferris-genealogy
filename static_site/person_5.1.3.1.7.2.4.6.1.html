            <div class="person-text">(5.1.3.1.7.2.4.6.1) ALFRED LAWSON STEARNS (Photo) born June 7, 1874 Ferris, Montcalm, MI
and died April 22, 1955; buried April 25, 1955 Ferris Center Cemetery, Ferris Township, Montcalm Co
MI; married 1st September 24, 1893 Jennie D. Jolly [dau of Francis &amp; Margaret (Pyle) Jolly] born
January 1875/76 Ferris Township, Montcalm Co MI and died 1947 (1950) Ionia MI; married 2d 1950
in Montcalm Co MI, Edna Ries Conner born November 16, 1883 and died January 27, 1978. Alfred
was County Clerk of Montcalm Co MI. He was reared on the paternal farm in Ferris Township,
receiving his education in the district school of that township, and remained at home until his marriage
in 1893, after which for several years he rented a farm, prospering in his farming operations until he
was able to buy a farm or 40 acres to which he added a tract of 20 acres which his wife inherited.
During all this time, he had been paying considerable attention to the political affairs of the county and
extending his acquaintance and was gradually getting in line for political preferment. He had served the
people of the township very acceptably as clerk for a period of 4 years and had been supervisor for 6
years; therefore, when he received the nomination for the office of county clerk on the Repubican ticket
in the fall of 1914, he was elected by a good majority in the ensuring election in the fall. He then rented
his farm to a tenant and moved to Stanton, the county seat. See History of Ionia and Montcalm
Counties, Michigan. Born to him and Jennie were:
