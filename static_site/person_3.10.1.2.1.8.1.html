            <div class="person-text">(3.10.1.2.1.8.1) DARIUS PECK born June 5, 1802 Norwich, Chenango, NY and died October 27,
1879; when his family settled in Cazenovia NY, schools of a higher grade being few and far distant, his
advantages for an early educated were limited to the common schools of the vicinity until he was about

17 years of age; prior to this time, however, his eager desire for intellectual improvement and for a
liberal education induced him to devote many of his evenings and much of his few intervals of leisure
from farming occupations to the acquirement of general and classical knowledge, and thus, by the aid
of appropriate books and the occasional assistance of a neighboring classical scholar, he became quite
proficient in the Latin language, and commenced fitting for college in the autumn of 1819 under Rev.
Daniel Hascall and Mr.Zenas Morse, Principal of Hamilton Academy, NY; October 1822 entered the
Sophmore Class of Hamilton College NY, from which he graduated August 1825; studied law with
Hon. Ambrose L. Jordan and William Slosson, in the cities of Hudson and New York; was admitted to
the bar of the Supreme Court of the State of New York in August, 1828, and in 1829 settled in as a
lawyer at the city of Hudson NY. In February 1833, he was appointed by the Governor and Senate of
the State of New York as the Recorder of the City of Hudson, then a judicial officer, as well as a
member of the Common Council of that City, which office he held until April 1843. He married,
September 12, 1836, Harriet M. Hudson, of Troy NY, born November 17, 1813 and died April 18, 1863
at age 49 years. Darius was for several years Superintendent of Schools and Master in Chancery; was
appointed in April, 1843 by the Governor of New York and Senate, a Judge of the Court of Common
Pleas of the County of Columbia NY, and in November 1855 was elected, and in November 1863 and
1867, was re-elected, County Judge of Columbia County. He was distinguished as a sound lawyer, and
an able, safe and reliable counselor; his high moral character, thorough knowledge of legal and
equitable principle, and their application, together with his long experience, inspired and secured the
utmost confidence of a large clientage in his own and adjoining counties; President of the Hudson City
Savings Institution; Author of Peck Genealogy. Born to them was:</div>
