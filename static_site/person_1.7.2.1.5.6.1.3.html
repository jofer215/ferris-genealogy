            <div class="person-text">(1.7.2.1.5.6.1.3) EDWARD LAWRENCE SCHIEFFELIN (Photos) born October 8,
1847 Tioga Co PA and died May 12, 1897 Day’s Creek, Douglas Co OR; Founder of
Tombstone AZ; Ed was prospecting in Mohave Co in northwest Arizona in the fall of
1877 when he got the chance to travel to the opposite end of the state with a company of
soldiers going to Fort Huachuca in the middle of the bloody Apacheria. A prospector
will always go somewhere he’s never been if it means a chance to look over new
territory. Ed went. After he arrived at Fort Huachuca, he saw in the color of the
surrounding hills something he liked. He was warned that if went out alone, looking for
his fortune, all he would find would be his tombstone. Disregarding this warning, Ed set

out alone. He was cautious enough never to make a move without searching the area for
even the slightest sign of the dreaded Apache. He never had a fire at night and always
slept among the boulders on a hillside. In the fall of 1877, Schiefflein struck pay dirt. He
knew the ore was rich, so he gathered samples and headed north to the tiny community
of Signal after deciding to call his strike The Tombstone. When assayed at Signal, the
strike proved to be rich indeed. In the company of his brother Al and the assayer,
Richard Gird, Ed headed back to his claim and the men began digging the rich ore. They
made their base camp about three miles north of where Tombstone is today. Eventually
the Schieffelin brothers sold their interests in the mine and left Tombstone wealthy
mean. Ed traveled the world, wore the most expensive clothes, ate at the best restaurants,
and was a curiosity to all who met the man who discovered a whole Mountain of Silver.
By 1883, Ed was tired of the rich life and headed to Alaska to prospect. He returned in
the fall to San Francisco where he married Mary Elizabeth Brown (married 1838 in La
Junta CO); a widow from VA, who had a daughter from her first marriage. In 1884, the
couple settled in Alameda CA, but the city life was not for Ed and he bought a ranch in
Oregon. Ed was found dead in his cabin on May 12, 1897; as per his request his body
was sent to Tombstone and he was buried beneath a prospectors mining claim monument
with all of his prospecting clothes and gear. See Tombstone on the Web.</div>
