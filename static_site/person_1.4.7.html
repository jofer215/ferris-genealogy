            <div class="person-text">(1.4.7) JOHN FERRIS born June 9, 1733 Throgs Neck, Westchester, NY and died
January 3, 1814 Grove Farm, Throgs Neck, Westchester, NY; farmer; in the 1755 Slave
Census, John is listed as a slave owner. He bought the Grove Farm 1775; married
December 15, 1756 in Westchester Co, Marianne “Myanna” (Mianah as listed in the
Marriage Licenses Book, 1860) Hunt [dau of Thomas &amp; Mary Anna (Patrick) Hunt of
Westchester] born c1733 and died July 9, 1809 Grove Farm, Throgs Neck, Westchester,
NY. Marianna, because of the affection of her husband who called her “May Anna”
became known as Myanna. This was a story told by her daughter Eliza. Eliza relates this
in her journals. She also tells that Myanna as a tiny woman but very brave. Many stories
are told of her bravery especially during the Revolution. These stories can be read in
Eliza Seaman Leggett’s journals. John bought Grove Farm from Joshua Causten in
October 1775. The farm was in the family for over 100 years being inherited by Elijah.
John was a farmer and the family was of the Quaker faith. On one of John’s trips to the
city, he went to arrange for a place for his daughters to live so they could attend school.

He came home from the trip- “Ma ma, I have found the most delightful place for our
daughters to live. It is with the Willett Seaman family.” But this concerned mother –
“..but they will be living with five boys..” “..not to worry dear, they are all so homily.”
Shortly after the girls lived there, Anna fell in love with the Seaman’s son, Valentine,
whom she later married. Their granddaughter, Eliza Seaman tells many stories of them &quot;My mother used to say that her name was Anna and that grandfather in his foundness
called her MY Anna and so the name came to be. I am quite inclined to think it was the
case, as my Mother was named Anna - and she said it was for her mother - well this My
Anna - as I will call her - was a wonderful little person - in all ways that appertaided to
home rule - and excellent housekeeping. Many aneodotes are related of her bravery
during the revolutionary war, the old house bears the marks of the British bullets. In this
great generous mansion there are four kitchens upon the first floor in range with sitting
or common room. To save time, you may know that everything in this home was on a
most generous scale, large rooms, hall kitchens, from the sitting room that had its
outlook over a great stretch of farm land you saw the Long Island Sound. The first
kitchen was next to this room - it also was very large. As we enter it from the back door
of the sitting room a swing door, or a door very common in the old house out in two
parts, the door could be closed to prevent children crawling out - and the upper to let in
light and air - there was a pavement of stones from a distance outside the kitchens, these
brot from the fields and adjusted as best they could be, putting the flat side uppermost.
The pump stood directly in front of the door perhaps 20 feet off, with a huge trough to
which the horses were brot to drink and in which ducks, geese, and children delighted to
dip into. Beside the door and its huge iron handle - which served also for a knocker was a deep bay window, a seat in it, where, children also delighted to climb into. A
small passage continuing on nearby the front wall led into the great (?) kitchen of all
where, when I was young, old Delilah, Dilly for short, reigned. What I am trying to
write about was during the Revolutionary War - opposite to the door that we came in
from the sitting room was the fireplace - to describe this I would have in every part of it
deal in the superlative not only as my childhood eyes saw it, but in measurement of
older years. It is yet - tall mantle fully six feet from the stone hearth that came halfway
to the sitting room door - these large hearths were to protect from the fire - if one of the
logs broke apart scattering coals and chunks - on the mantle were the tinder box, pipes
and the gun with many useful traps but the glory was the open fire place. Nevermind
how wide or deep it was Mrs. Beecher in her will describes it to you. A stuff green
curtain was tacked on the mantle and hung down perhaps of a yard, this to carry the
smoke. Children could site inside this spacious place - one each side of the blazing fire

and crack nuts or eat apples and listen to stories, but one place in the side of the fireplace
was funny - it looked like a little oven but had no door to it - it was built perhaps three
feet into the wall. In this a baby could be cuddled after it was put to sleep and lay as
snug as a bug in a rug for any indefinite period. Cupboards, two, that nearly reached to
the ceiling - quite fanciful these with scolloped shelves and painted red inside - were
filled with queer old China much mended some of it - ancient all probably came into our
country when the first great he and she of our family &quot;Came over&quot;. Much of it wedgewood ever so pretty. As to their value - would bring if not almost their weight in gold
for they were very heavy - yet fabulous prices - following along the wall we come to the
door leading into the hall - then a turn and we get to the door leading to that mysterious
region the cellar, oh these cellars of our grandfather - full of salt water - delicacies in
winter oysters, clams, soft clams also - all cured with sea weed, great heaps of these that
were fed every day or two with Indian meal - and a sprinkling of salt water - and they
grew fat, Yum, Yum - if you read the times of the old war, you will know something of
the Hoboys and Skinners scamps who stole from friend and foe alike, landless, reckless who prowled about the farm homes seeking what they might not only devour but to
carry off the cattle and sheep, chickens anything. So many homes were left unprotected
with women and a few servants, perhaps slaves in those days. The home was a mile
from the main road or from any neighbor. The farm itself was quite a territory. You
know in those days farms were not bought by the acre but by the mile so Grove Farm
extended for many miles. When I was a child and heard my uncles tell, I thought, it
embraced all of the West Chester, well it was a grand place for those fellows to attach Grandfather was often way with his sloop, perhaps taking a load of oysters or farm truck
to the city, New York, for all farm produce brot large prices - this middle kitchen was
where the mothers and daughters did the nicer cooking - preserving, cake making - often
churning - and find ironing and clear starching - a very useful place - Now our
grandmother was making dough-nuts, most savory odor. Now too there came tramping a
set of these outlaws and came into this middle kitchen; our little grandmother knew no
fear - but she knew well enough what this sudden incoming meant, in a flash, she
thought of the barns, horses, cows, sheep - everything. A big big fire blazing on the
hearth with great inviting wooden arm chairs - how good it did look and feel to those
fellows after their tramp in the snow. They waited no invitation to be seated and the
wooden bowl full of foamy dough and the smell of the frying cakes - grandmother gave
her kitchen of (?) to a girl who and sent her into the kitchen proper where some servants
had come in to toast by the fire and said, &quot;Sit down boys, and we will have some cider
for you.&quot; The boys felt sure of their game and the smell of the cakes, and the prospect of

cheer beguiled them and good little grandmother knew how to make the best of a bad
situation. It was not the first time that these gangs had been about. The cider was hot set by the fire to heat - good strong cider, with a drop in it. Always there was a plan laid,
if an attack threatened.
Oh, the grand-mothers of the war time. She joked with the boys saying you&#x27;ve caught us
this time, you are more lucky than those fellow who came around last, but be easy with
us. I&#x27;ll treat you well, so don&#x27;t destroy what you don&#x27;t take, you know the Quakers are
peaceable and make friends with everybody, even those who called enemies - but in the
providence of things all are one in the sight of the Father. The cider began to work, the
hot good cakes did their share and being so softlyen sconced and knowing the man of
the house was away, they ate and frank and snoozed a little and the time went on. Finally
they went to the barns - to find that all the live stock had been driven to West Chester,
and a small army of neighbors had come with guns to help their neighbor - they had
been fairly beaten and no blood shed - then our little grandmother laid her hands on her
hips and laughed for she was a merry woman, and old Sam, the master par excellence
among the servants, said, &quot;We did better then the masta could.&quot; And for his ready wit
was filled with cider and dough-nuts.
Another Story of Myannah. As I have said Grandfather was often from home,
feeling so safe with leaving his better half at home to protect the house. It was as stone
house with walls two feet if not more thick, heavy windows, shutters well ironed - &quot;Sam,
Misses was coming&quot; - &quot;All right Sam, call the boys, get the girls, find all the guns,
shovels, big boats they&#x27;ll think it is an army. Make all the noise you can, bolt the doors,
call down stairs up stairs, tramp like horses, point the guns and fire, load fast, get at
different windows. Some get to the top chambers - don&#x27;t be afraid - fire away - and raise
away. Thus the little grandmother again - the Skinners, for it was just a party of them,
thought the house was garrisoned and again the little woman put her hands on her hips
and laughed and the castle was saved.
Another bit, being Quakers, they were non-combatants - but some had declared &quot;the
old fellow must have money hidden. They would catch him. Perhaps it was intuition.
Never mind, it was her business to take care of her husband, and seeing danger she
meant to get him safe - there had been a talk among the neighbors that &quot;they were after
Massa&quot; This had been floating in the air. &quot;Take your master Sam - open a hole in the
stone wall of the orchard, build it up around him - take your gun - a good ways off from
him - and do as tho you were saving the orchard, keep away from him - and if you have
to fire among them the boys will be armed and ready to jump for them. All night
grandfather laid in his stone chamber, all night Sam took care of the orchard. Nothing

was hurt. They went off, swearing they would come another day for the d---d Quaker
and grandmother had a nice boiled chicken for the beloved man she meant to take care
of - many stories of this brave woman, full of fun and vim - from my mothers many
stories. The word fear had no meaning to &quot;Wyannah&quot; - the hall was broad but was much
broadened at the far end, here in the old time was the dining room - all the meals were
eaten there in the summer. I rather think the middle kitchen was used in winter. My
grandfather was a mild autocrat - and was called &quot;Master&quot;, but his wonderfully bright
alost wife was the soul of the manor, wise enough to make him believe he was the ruler.
She loved her John with a true heart - always she the first up is the morning to be about
tending to the spinning girl, seeing that the host in the kitchen were up and around. (?)
Grandfather left to finish his morning nap. Always in the cellar hung a tender chicken or
two ready for the coals and dearly she liked to pet her husband suggesting his poor
appetite, if he waited a little before he ate, &quot;Go Kate, throw a chicken on the coals, your
master would like to have it.&quot; I fancy the said chick was very near done when Katy went
for it, for mother said it came on the table in an incredibly short space of time, then
grandmother would say, &quot;John, try to eat it.&quot; Probably, grandfather John had been filled
with a good lunch at bed time, with perhaps a pleasant night cap of Punch so common in
those days of coaring. At one time, they had a well there with buckets - a child in
playing fall in - grandmother saw it and in a moment caught the rope of the bucket and
swung herself down and brot up her drenched child. Mother said she never waited to
parley - fearless - quick to comprehend - first in the home. She died long before I born.
Oh dear, I had no grandparents living as I have said and oh how I have yearned for
them, saved every item I can get - few indeed - if I had lived in the East I could have
gotten more - With what reverence I used to look at the ancient furniture in the room
where she and grandfather slept. I seemed to have realized the latter from knowing my
uncle Elijah Ferris being there so much during my childhood he somehow fell heir to the
homestead and there it wasand is, not very different in its outward look from the aims
the Skinners and Bautboys made their raids. Uncle Elijah was a splendid looking man
much too as mother used to describe her father. &quot;The master&quot;, he too was called, and
was the same as I have said by nature a mild sort of autocrat and his wife, the second
she, I knew, petted him much in the way that as he said his mother had petted his father.
Uncle Elijah like his father was sort of noble of the manor always a plate was set for the
stranger that might come at meal time, always a beautiful table. At one end the famous
hams, which was a part of the institution of the house. Every Saturday morning, old
Billy had the famous iron pet swung upon the crane filled with cold water and in it, the
ham. Never a ham was eaten until it was a year old - ripe - cured with such a receipe as

a king would like to have - so much sugar, so much salt petre - well all day the kettle
swung on the orange with a gentle simmer just up to the edge of boiling. To Dilly, if the
master who at interval came to see how it progressed found it boiling, &quot;Dilly&quot;, he would
say in strong emphasis, &quot;do you know that this ham is perhaps ruined?&quot; If uncle said
&#x27;you&#x27; with emphasis so contrary to his Quaker language, the castle &#x27;thee&#x27;, even to the dog
and horses they said &#x27;thee&#x27;, Dilly never much alarmed at her master&#x27;s &#x27;you&#x27; said, &quot;I&#x27;ll see
to that Master Ferris.&quot; He was no master for Dilly for she held the rod of empire thro the
length and breadth of that farm and she knew it well - Yet generally the old gentleman
tried to be as I have said the mild supreme - and dilly upheld him in this except as
regarding her own position. Every cow knew when the soothing bitter sweet ointment
was softly rubbed on the bruised parts of it&#x27;s hurt leg that all would be well. The poor
boy Dick who had chill blains got well when Dilly planted him in the corner of the
kitchen chimney and put a pail of salt hay under his frost bites - and set the hay while his
feet seemed boiling over the hot stuff. Take his feet off? Not a stir until Aunt Dilly said
they could, if ever the Son worked anywhere it did under that potent withered bent old
woman, her shoulders I can only describe in this way, if a large pumpkin were out in two
and the half put over her shoulders and her dress drawn over it, it would look like Dilly&#x27;s
shoulders, the seams of her face looked as tho they were smoked, deep seams. She was
a white woman, altho the smoke from the fire place and from her pipe had left indelible
marks, so bent was she one had to look down and under to see really well, her face remember Augustus that now I am talking of the time when my uncle Elijah was the
master and when I was a little girl that this Aunt Dilly held away - I wish you could have
been a little boy then, too, but then you know, it was not possible - but oh how you
would have enjoyed seeing Uncle Elijah toast the sausage&quot;, you see then the sausage
meat was shopped in a famous big trough and for a week in the winter evenings all the
available force of servants and axes, cleavers, short hatchets had been plied to get the
meat fine enough to be packed in jars, some of it also in skins - finally Dilly said, &quot;its
fine enough you&#x27;d ort to have had it down long ago.&quot; Well, then for the seasoning. To
so much meat so much salt, black pepper, a &quot;leetle&quot; osyene - let it lay over night with the
seasoning to get thro it - next night always there was a sort of charm about night work,
the hogs must e cut at night, doughnuts cooked, nuts cracked to put away in large
earthen jars - &quot;to (?) ready.&quot; Always this the watchword, to &quot;be ready&quot; beautiful in its
meaning of hospitality. In the living room a blazing fire the blaze lighting the whole
room altho Uncle Elijah had the round stand with the two brass candlesticks and in the
tray all as bright - as rubbing and rotten stone could make them, so were the and irons with their steeple tops - in the days of your ancestors anything that could be make bright

- by hands were - red lead for painting the bricks of the fire place, potlead for
brightening any iron lid - whiting for silver, and wax for furniture. If only your mother
could have lived in those days when even the pots and kettles used in the kitchen were
made as bright as a knife blade for two inches below the rim.&quot;
The Ferris family &quot;burying ground&quot; this is the way they were designated, has
received far before the Revolutionary War the departed of the Ferris family. My
grandparents lie there, John and Mary Ferris, my own mother, brother Percival Seaman,
but my brother Doctor William F. Seaman and my sister Marianna Middlebrok were
buried in North Street - the bodies or as much as could be fathered of them were taken a
few years ago to Greenwood, the society of friends burying ground attached to
Greenwood Cemetery but as no one knows of a single dear one - oh! My beautiful
beloved sister Marianna, my revered father, and my dearly almost worshipped brother
William - think not of their graves and try to take them to my soul as being still
conscious of my never-dying love...&quot;
The good Grandmother Myannah, how she was always the first one up in the horse
and did not disturb Grandfather until the breakfast was ready - generally he was down
by this time - but on his not coming his grandson Lyndley M. Ferris, a little boy, was
sent up to call him - and found him seated on the side of the bed partly dressed. He
turned to Lyndley and said, &quot;I&#x27;m dying, and before the family could be called, he was
gone...&quot;
&quot;Myanna Hunt Ferris died later of colic supposed to come from eating cherries and
drinking milk - was sick but a short time; so the brave little grandmother passed from the
home in which she had been the great power.&quot; Note: This information has been
