            <div class="person-text">(3.1.1.3.1) NATHANIEL REYNOLDS, Jr., born February 22, 1754 Cross River, Westchester, NY and
died there September 21, 1843; age 89y 6m 29d; farmer, tailor, and an auctioneer who was sometimes
his own best customer; at an auction in February 1806, he bought, among other things, &#x27;Tooth Pullers&#x27;.
As a tailor, he made coats for the British when they imprisoned him. Nathaniel was a Revolutionary
War Veteran and was married while serving with General Morris’ Brigade; later he was in Captain
Henry Slausen&#x27;s Company; then he enlisted as a Lieutenant in Captain Samuel Lawrence&#x27;s Company,
an infantry unit of the Third Westchester Militia Regiment. His company was called to fill gaps in the
lines of the Continental Army. They were also often assigned to stand guard duty. It was on one such
duty, June 24, 1779, that he and his men were attacked by British soldiers near Crumppond (Katonah),
taken prisoner and sent to the infamous Sugar House Prison in New York City. Most of the lower rank
soldiers were released but Lieutenant Reynolds was held and later sent to a British prison, which had
been set up on Long Island. He remained a prisoner for over two years, and was exchanged for British
prisoners October 24, 1781. He always remained a soldier, even in peacetime. He was commissioned
First Lieutenant in Captain Joseph Benedict&#x27;s Company, Westchester Militia, 1786. With all that, he

spent years filing petitions for his military pension. Finally, in 1831, at age 77, he received his first
pension check - $240.00 annually. He married, October 15, 1778, at the Church of Christ, Salem,
Westchester Co NY, widow Hannah (Todd) Cooley [dau of Abraham &amp; Lydia (Husted) Todd, of South
Salem NY] [widow of Daniel Cooley and brought with her a son, Daniel Cooley, Jr.] born May 26,
1759 at Greenwich and died April 11, 1846 at Cross River; both buried at Reynolds Cemetery, Cross
River, Westchester, NY (Photos). Hannah received an annual pension of $320.00 for Nathaniel&#x27;s Rev
War service until her death. Born to Nathaniel and Hannah were:</div>
