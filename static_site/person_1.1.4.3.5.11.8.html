            <div class="person-text">(1.1.4.3.5.11.8) WILLIAM AUGUSTINE JAYCOX born March 18, 1863 Putnam Valley
NY and died there January 14, 1899; buried South Highland Cemetery, Philipstown NY;
never married; graduated from Union College 1887 and in 1892 was honored with the
degree of AM; admitted to the bar 1889 and commenced the practice of his profession at
Brooklyn NY where he continued for 2 years. The air there was detrimental to his health
and he relocated to Dobbs Ferry NY, where he continued in the law until 1896 when ill
health compelled him to seek rest and retirement. He traveled extensively for the next 3
years, throughout the South and West with the hope that the change of air would
improve his health – it didn’t!</div>
