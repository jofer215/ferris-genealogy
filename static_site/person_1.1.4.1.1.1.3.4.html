A Letter from Aunt Sarah Riddick Sweet
Dear Ginny,
I will try to remember all the stuff that Marion told me. Marion said that Dick&#x27;s father, Robert, fell in love with the woman
who lived in the vacation home next to his up in Maine. There were two houses side by side just alike. Margery&#x27;s family
lived in the other house. They must have married in the summer after Robert&#x27;s first year at Dartmouth. Married students
were not allowed and they asked him to leave. Dr. Sweet was very upset about the situation and refused to support them.
Robert worked at many low level jobs until some bank in Boston hired him. Both Jane and Judy told me that he was playing
around with women and had to leave Boston. That is when he went to New York to work. As you know New York is much
more liberal that Boston, especially in that day. Her mother&#x27;s best friend introduced Marion to Robert at lunch in NYC. She
fell in love with him immediately as he was very handsome and very funny and very athletic. I don&#x27;t know what caused the
scaring on Josephine&#x27;s face but it did not keep Dr. Sweet from loving her! The story about Dr. Sweet is that he was a
principal of a school in Troop County, NY but was very ambitious. When he saw a man drive by in a fine carriage pulled by
beautiful horse she was told that he was the town doctor and the richest man in town! Dr. Sweet then decided to become a
doctor! He went to Cornell Medical School in NYC but never graduated according to the school records. It was a
homeopathic school at that time. He then went to Rochester, NH (we don&#x27;t know why) and told a friend that he would marry
the richest woman in town! He was the most eligible bachelor and much sought after but chose Josephine! Because they
were the MOST PROMINENT FAMILY they controlled the town, as they owned the largest business in town (shoe
factory). Dr. Sweet became the President of the Racetrack Association and eventually was elected Mayor of the town. He
must have been a likable and intelligent fellow! The kids grew up in the country club life. Since Dr. Sweet was working and
Josephine had a heart condition after bearing all those children I am sure the kids got away with a lot. (Remember that there
was no anesthesia in those days so all the children were born by natural childbirth!) From the stories that I have heard from
all the family members, Dick&#x27;s father must have been quite a handful! The chocolate on his mouth in that photo is an
indication that he was quite mischievous! Polly Matthews told us the reason that Dr. Sweet bought the Maine house was to
make life easier for his wife! However, when she told us that they traveled to Maine by horse and carriage, I now have a
new appreciation for how very hard life was in those days. They tied the cow to the back of the buggy so that the children
would have fresh milk! Can you imagine how slow they would have to travel and how long the trip must have been! Dick
tells me that his memory of Dr. Sweet was of a very proper gentleman who always wore a suit - even at the Maine house!
He never drank any alcoholic drink. Marion told me that once when he came for a visit she offered the doctor a beer and
was surprised when he accepted! Dick said before his visits to the Maine house they would hide all the liquor bottles in the
basement. He remembers the kids lining up the bottles on the sea wall and getting into trouble for that! When we visited
Polly Matthews in Schenectady, NY Marion warned us that she would serve iced tea which was fine with me because that is
how I grew up! We looked at the many interesting photos of Dr. Sweet&#x27;s family. The women wore long dress even when
playing croquet on the lawn and the doctor was always dressed in a suit! There was great emphasis on intellectual
development. At the table Dick&#x27;s father would quiz the kids on the state capitals and such intellectual games. I found the
Sweet family a very fascinating group of people. Aunt SARAH
