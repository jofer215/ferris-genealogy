            <div class="person-text">(3.6.3.2.2.2.2.6.2) ANNA MAE HILL born August 20, 1891 and died June 1978; married Walton
Jagger. Henry Emery was raised by his Aunt Anna, who lived in Blairstown along the Pauline’s Kill.
She was a very generous woman who was suspicious of bankers (she said that you don’t have to bury
bankers when they die, they are so crooked, you can just screw them into the ground.) She had
wonderful feather beds that had made herself. She always refused to reveal her age.</div>
