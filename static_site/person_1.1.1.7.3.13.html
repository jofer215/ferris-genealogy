Brooklyn Eagle, March 6, 1881: Last night a meeting of the property owners of the Seventh Ward was held at the residence
of Mr. Morris P. Ferris, 45 Cambridge place, to consider the improvement of the square bounded by Greene, Grand, Classon
and Lafayette avenues, and intersected from Grand to Classon avenue by Clifton place. The land is 725 by 470 feet, and its
assessed value is $90,360. It forms part of the Jackson Hollow farm, and consists of 119 lots, owned by some thirty different
persons. It is proposed to close Clifton place, and seek through legislative aid to convert the whole into a beautiful park.
There were present Dr. Gatlin, Mr. Lynde A. Catlin, Mr. J.S. Stearns, Mr. Isaac Howland, Mr. F. C. Clark, Mr. C. Elmore,
Mr. A. Ward Brigham, and Mr. A. Comstock. Hon. W. H. Waring and others. The meeting was called to order by Mr. Ferris,
and Mr. James S. Stearns was chosen chairman and Mr. Ferris secretary. Mr. Waring said that the object was contemplated
some time ago, but owing to one thing and another nothing was done. Mr. Ferris, in answer to a question, said that the actual
value of the property was about $150,000, and the whole value of property in the ward was estimated at $15,000,000. If the
assessment was laid on an area extending 1,000 or 1,500 feet in circuit, the expense could be met by an assessment of 1 ½
per cent, extending over several years. Mr. Clark thought that the property was worth more than twice the sum named. Mr.
Waring described the condition of the part of Jackson Hollow referred to, and said that if the property owners desired him to
represent them, he was willing to do so. A park would not only beautify the neighborhood, but it would also improve the
adjacent property and afford the children of residents a pleasant resort. Mr. Ferris thought the only way to get possession of
the property was to have it appropriated for a park. It could not be bought, as the title was in dispute. The only piece of
property on the land which was really valuable was on the corner of Lafayette and Classon avenues. Mr. Ferris moved that a
committee of three be appointed to circulate petitions among the residents in favor of the project, and to see to the
preparation of a bill to be submitted to the Legislature. The motion was seconded. In answer to a question, Mr. Waring said
that commissioners would be appointed whose duty it would be to take testimony as to the value of the land and appraise
the damages accordingly. Mr. Clark could not indorse the statement that more parks were required. Certain disadvantages
attached to all small parks and a new park would not be exempt. He considered the land undervalued, and it was a question
to be considered whether the property owners were prepared to pay a 4 or 4 ½ per cent assessment. It was desirable to make
Brooklyn as attractive as possible, especially as they were likely soon to have rapid transit, and it would be an unfortunate
thing to oppress the property with assessments. Mr. Waring said that small parks could be well taken care of by the police,
and he thought there would not be the same difficulty here as at Fort Greene or large parks such as that. As to the lots in the
Hollow, they were unsaleable, and Mr. Waring did not believe that lots there would sell at any price. New tenements had
been put up and a scaling was factory, and these would give character to the place. The expense was trifling in comparison
to the benefit to be derived by adjacent owners. The construction of a park would give character to the locality at once.
Jackson Hollow had kept back Classon avenue, which was better situated than Clinton avenue. Mr. Anthony Comstock said
that the titles to much of the property contiguous to the block spoken of were clouded. He thought that, if the block was
made into a park, many capitalists would be induced to risk something, or to go to the expense of getting a good title. They
desired to get rid of an eyesore. They had a cockpit and a dog pit at the corner of Greene and Grand avenues, but it
disappeared, and the best way was to fight the devil at their own doors. He strongly advocated the construction of a park in
the locality named, even though the cost exceeded $150,000. Mr. Isaac Howland suggested that some limitation be placed as
to the amount of assessment. He did not wish to see the gates opened too wide. Mr. L. A. Catlin asked whether the cost of
developing the park might not also be put on property owners. Mr. Waring thought the expense would not be large, and it
could be spread over some time. The meeting elected as a committee Mr. Ferris, Dr. Catlin and Mr Stearns. Mr. Catlin said
that he thought there would be no difficulty in getting a bill reported favorably. The meeting was adjourned.
