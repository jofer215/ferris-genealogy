            <div class="person-text">(1.1.3.1.10.5) DAVID F. FERRIS born June 24, 1841 Peekskill; according to a General
Affidavit contained in pension papers, prior to enlisting, David worked his father&#x27;s place,
at Peekskill, &quot;about 20 acres of rough land&quot; for three or four years supporting himself
and his parents out of the produce he raised upon the place. In addition, for the two
winters prior to enlisting, David taught school and the money he earned went for the
support of the Family. David&#x27;s father, William B., was of feeble health, resulting from
Inflammatory Rheumatism, which he had for at least thirty years and during that time
was unable to work his land. He was 5&#x27;9&quot; tall with blue eyes and black hair. David had

just graduated from Albany State Normal School when he enlisted at Albany NY on the
14th day of August, 1862 as a Private in Company C. of the 44th Regiment of New York
Volunteers, afterwards transferring to the 146th Regiment New York Volunteers, from
which on October 7, 1864, he was transferred to the Battalion Sharpshooters of the
140th Regiment New York Volunteers.. Sergeant David F. Ferris was killed by a minnie
ball in the right groin on March 31, 1865 in the Battle of Five Forks (Battle of White
Oak Road), VA. David died within a few hours and was buried at that site.[Another
source says there is a tombstone at Hillside Cemetery for David; &quot;a true soldier and a
faithful friend, beloved brother and son. His remains may have been moved and buried
besides his parents.] The pension papers contain a General Affidavit from George W.
Cozine, who served with David and assisted in David&#x27;s burial. David never married.</div>
