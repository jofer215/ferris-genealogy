AFN:378X-9S
born c1640 Charlestown MA (LDS says born 1634 at Greenwich CT) (if 1640 is correct,
then John would have been the 4th of the 5 children born to Jeffrey, instead of the first as
numbered here; he will remain here for now; I am not renumbering everyone – too much
trouble, so John stays here.) Removed to Throg&#x27;s Neck, Westchester Co, N.Y., about
1665 and died there (Flushing, Long Island?) after May (March?) 15, 1715 (LDS says he
died at Throg’s Neck, February 5, 1716); John Ferris was one five grantees (patentee) on
the original Westchester Patent, granted February 13, 1667 by Governor Nichols, who
evidently perceiving the folly of having Westchester a portion of the Long Island
jurisdiction, granted to the people the first patent of Westchester. The boundaries were,
on the west the Bronx River, on the east Ann&#x27;s Hook or Pelham Neck, and on the north
&quot;into the woods without limitation for range cattle&quot;. The Governor gave the patentees all
the rights and privileges of a township, and provided that the place should be called
Westchester. This John Ferris was called John Sr. in 1683 when he was chosen fenceviewer. John accumulated considerable land in Westchester County NY. On March 11,
1686, John and others, the inhabitants of West Chester, in relation to the grant of 500
acres of land to John West, praying that the same may be revoked. [Source unknown for
the following: John was accused of bestiality by Henry Ackerly in 1657 and the court of
New Haven CT ruled that John needed to be publicly whipped in New Haven. Once he
healed from this ordeal, he was publicly whipped again in Stamford CT. Between the
whippings, he was kept in prison and also had to pay 20 pounds. He was forced to wear
a halter around his neck at all times. John begged the court to discontinue the wearing of
the halter and they allowed it after two years of humiliation.] In later years he became a
Quaker and made provisions in his will for the Quaker Burying Ground on his land.

(Jim - This has been typed verbatum from a copy. I, of course, did not attempt to run it
through the computer&#x27;s spell checker. You don&#x27;t suppose John didn&#x27;t trust his son, Peter,
do you?)
He was a trustee of Westchester NY in 1693-4. John married first, Mary Jackson
(AFN:C461-43) [dau of Robert &amp; Agnes (Washburne) Jackson of Hempstead, L.I., NY],
born circa 1658 (questionable date), Hempstead, Queens NY and died, 1704. John
married second, in 1705, Grace Pawling (AFN:C461-58) (a widow and his
housekeeper), who died at Flushing, Long Island, December (February) 31, 1716. Born
to John and Mary were (sequence of birth is questionable/doubtful here based on
Chaplain Ferris&#x27; information, but I am leaving them in this sequence, for now)[Mary
Jackson is not listed in the will of Robert Jackson, so this can lead to doubt of this
Mary’s surname.] [Jim - more confusion - The New York Genealogical and Biographical
Record, Volume 126, No. 4, October, 1995 says that the widow Grace (Norrington)
Burling (1.7) was John’s second wife. [The McCurdys propose that the order of birth of
John’s offspring is as follows: John c1667; Mary c1669; Martha c1671; Samuel c1673;
Phoebe c1657; James c1677; Hannah 1679; Jonathan c1681; Sarah c1683; and Peter
c1685. Thanks folks.]
A letter from Harriet Scofield: &quot;John Ferris born in 1640, as on December 5 th, 1705 he
gave his age as 65. It appears that John was a minor when he was before the New Haven
Court in 1657/9 as a resident of Greenwich, Connecticut, and he went to Westchester
soon thereafter in 1659/60. His proprietor’s rights were derived from his father, who was
there on January 1, 1657, when the Dutch Expedition reported that a party of
Englishmen, including Jeffrey Ferris, had started a settlement at &quot;Oostrdorp&quot;. Both
Jeffrey and Jonathan Lockwood were among those at Oostdorp (Easttowne in English
records) who took the oath of allegiance to the Dutch governor at that time. Apparently
Jeffrey left, not because of antagonism to the Dutch, but to leave his rights to his son,
John. This would also account for his not mentioning John in his will – John having
already received most of his portion. But the two elder brothers, Peter and Joseph, who
were executors of that will, apparently gave some Greenwich land to John after their
father’s death, which John sold to James stating that in the deed that it had been willed
‘to my by my honored father, Jeffere Ferris’. This was sold to his ‘loving cosen’ James
Ferris, natural son unto my brother, James Ferris of Greenwich.&quot; (It is apparent here that
the word ‘cosen’ actually means nephew)

More Scofield notes: &quot;That statement that he moved from Greenwich, Ct., to
Westchester, New York in 1654, as one of the first patentees is manifestly in error, as he
was then only 14 years old. He did not sign the agreement of submission of Greenwich
citizens to New Haven authority in 1656, as did his brothers Peter and Joseph, as he was
probably under age and they were of age. In 1657, in a trial in New Haven, he was
called of Greenwich, and also two years later in New Haven Court Records. It was
perhaps because of this trial that he removed to Westchester County.&quot;
A letter from Edward E. Ferris, Mason MI, 1977 – &quot;For swearing on a Sunday, John
went around in disgrace for two years. Jeffrey took him from Connecticut down to
Throggs Point, New York and bought him 40 acres of land. John straightened out and
did well during his life. I have a copy of his will. His son James and grandson James,
built a large house on Throggs Point. I have a picture of this house and a write-up about
it that was in a New York newspaper. The house was torn down about 20 years ago to
make room for a country club.&quot;
Scofield notes: &quot;John Ferris accumulated considerable land in Westchester County New
York. In later years he became a Quaker and made provision in his will for the Quaker
Burying Ground on his land. He was trustee of Westchester NY in 1693-4. He was one
of the first patentees of Throckmorton’s Neck (also known as Throgg’s Neck and Frog’s
Neck).
You have the wife of John Ferris as follows:
&quot;John married first, Mary Jackson (AFN:C461-43) [dau of Robert &amp; Agnes (Washburne) Jackson of Hempstead, L.I., NY],
who was born circa 1658 (questionable date), Hempstead, Queens NY and died, 1704. John married second, in 1705, Grace
Pawling (AFN:C461-58) (a widow and his housekeeper), who died at Flushing, Long Island, December (February) 31,
1716.&quot;
The Agnes Washburne myth has been circulating for quite a while. However, I think it has been satisfactorily disproved by
the research of Harry Macy, Jr., published in &quot;The New York Genealogical and Biographical Record&quot;. The gist of his
argument is (as transcribed on the Jackson family web page):
&quot;The idea that Robert Jackson&#x27;s wife was Agnes Washburn derives from two documents. Court testimony in 1659 regarding
William Washburn&#x27;s will establishes that Jackson was married to Washburn&#x27;s daughter (without giving her name), and
Jackson&#x27;s own 1683 will names a wife Agnes.
&quot;What the creators of &quot;Agnes Washburn&quot; failed to notice was that the court testimony clearly states that Jackson&#x27;s wife was
deceased. On 5 June 1659 &quot;only Robert Jackson... protested against the said will on behalf of his deceased wife and two
female children that are now living, had by the daughter of the aforesaid testator.&quot; In the will, made in September 1657,
William Washburn gave &quot;to Sara the daughter of Robert Jackson one yearling heifer,&quot; but did not mention Sara&#x27;s mother, his
daughter, and no record has been found that gives her first name. All we can safely say is that Robert Jackson married a
Washburn.
&quot;Based on the likely birth dates of his children, Robert Jackson&#x27;s marriage to Miss Washburn probably took place about
1650-53.

&quot;In 1661 John Winthrop, Jr., made an entry in his medical journal for &quot;Pudington of Hempstead, 13 years old, daughter of
Robert Jackson&#x27;s wife of Hempstead.&quot; Robert Puddington (or Purington) was a resident of Newtown (then Middelburg),
Long Island, in January 1657. Agnes&#x27; maiden name has not been found. Her marriage to Robert Jackson probably took place
around 10 April 1660, when he purchased a house in Maspeth Kills, Newtown. He is last mentioned in the Newtown records
29 October 1670, when he and Agnes sold a farm at Maspeth Kills, &quot;this same farme that was Robert Pudingtons formerly,&quot;
and &quot;Agnesse my wife&quot; signed with her mark. Finally, in his 1683 will Robert Jackson mentioned a great deal of movable
property that was to go to Agnes, some of which he described as that &quot;which she brought with her,&quot; wording that usually
means the wife had a prior marriage.
&quot;In the 1659 Washburn will testimony... Robert Jackson protested only on behalf of &quot;two female children that are now
living, had by the daughter of the aforesaid testator,&quot; despite the fact that at this time he had at least one more daughter and
two sons, all probably still minors. This strongly suggests that these other children were not born of Jackson&#x27;s Washburn
wife . . . .
&quot;It is also unlikely that William Washburn had a daughter old enough to bear all these children. Thus it would appear that
before he married Miss Washburn, Robert Jackson had at least one other wife, whose name is totally unknown to us, and she
was the mother of at least three of his children. This previous marriage most likely took place in England prior to
emigration.&quot; From Marty Grundy
