            <div class="person-text">(5.1.2.6.4.8) ANGELINE FERRIS born c1825 NY and died April 30, 1892 Windham, Greene, NY;
buried Pleasant Valley Cemetery, Ashland NY; married Thomas Anderson Branaugh [son of Archibald
&amp; Jane (Anderson) Branaugh] born 1826 Ireland and died May 25, 1907 Windham, Greene, NY.
Thomas arrived in this country when he was about 6 months old with his parents and siblings. He
stayed with his family until he was past his majority, when he joined his brother Samuel, who had
engaged in tanning, in Herkimer County, where he remained for 3 years, when he returned to Ashland,
married Angeline, and purchased his father’s farm and engaged in farming. There he remained until
about 1855, when he moved to North Settlement, on the farm near the church, where he continued to
reside until about 1869, when he purchased the 700-acre farm of Col. George Robertson above Union
Society. He resided there until about 1890, when he moved to Windham into the home of his father.
About two years later the Robertson farm was traded for Brooklyn residential property, which the
deceased successfully managed, and it remains as part of the large estate owned by the deceased. Mr.
Branaugh was a man of large frame, with an iron constitution. He was accommodating, kind to his
neighbors, and willing always to lend a helping hand. In 1893 he represented the town of Windham in
the Board of Supervisors, with the same good judgment and care he always used in his own business.
“The death of the wife of Supervisor Thomas Branaugh removes a very estimable wife and mother. She
had been a very great sufferer for some months, but bore all with quiet patience”. Born to them were:</div>
