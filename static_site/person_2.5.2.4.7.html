            <div class="person-text">(2.5.2.4.7) THADDEUS HAIT (Hoyt) (#3019) (Rev.) born January 26, 1742/3 Stamford and died there
October 3, 1826; buried Old Woodland Cemetery, Stamford. His entire life was spent in his native
town, where he became a man of influence, and, for the age in which he lived, of quite considerable
wealth. During the Revolutionary War he was one of the most earnest and efficient advocates of
independence. He was in the Revolutionary Army in New York City in 1776; was on a commission to
supply commissary with clothing in December 1777 and was quite noted as a scout against the
cowboys. Thaddeus was one of the most earnest Whigs. His active patriotism had aroused the hatred of
every Tory in the neighborhood, and exposed him to incessant annoyance and hazard from their raids
upon his property or their attacks upon his person. So much exposed was he in his house by night that
he often retired in the evening with his gun and blanket to a neighboring clump of cedars, which
afforded him safer shelter. His cattle were all marked for seizure, and one by one they were stealthily
carried off. Having good evidence that one of his Tory neighbors, Samuel Lockwood, was a leader of
these depredations, he determined upon confronting him, on one of his predatory incursions. The
opportunity soon came. The neighbor had selected just such cattle as would best answer his purpose,
and was hurrying off to the British lines with his prize. Suddenly, Uncle Thad, arrests his progress. The
Tory, thus unexpectedly caught, quickly levels his gun and snaps. The musket, loyal to the King, failed
her duty to his subject. Not to be thus defeated, uncle Thad, strikes down the gun, grapples with the
Tory, himself, and holds him in his unrelenting grasp. Nor does he release his hold before, thoroughly
subdued, he begs for quarter and pledges a future abandonment of his Tory practices. He married
1st April 28, 1766 Hannah Holmes (5.2.3.6) and 2d c1805 Sarah Lockwood (4.6.1.2.2).
