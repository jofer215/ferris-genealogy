            <div class="person-text">(1.2.3.3.5.1.5) MARTHA UNDERHILL born c1819 York Co NB and died February 28,
1853 Norfolk Co, Ontario in childbirth; resided Walsingham, Norfolk, Ontario; married
March 1835 near Simcoe, Norfolk, Ontario, Nathaniel Dennis [son of Nathaniel &amp;
Lucinda] born January 1, 1813 VT (near Lake Erie in Canada) and died October 4, 1883
Redding, Shasta, CA; buried Redding Memorial Park; farmer, rancher, homesteader;
after Martha died, Nathaniel remarried and he and his new wife traveled in covered
wagons for a new life in Iowa and they had 11 more kids; and born to Martha and
Nathaniel were:
When Martha was 3 years old, her family moved from York Co., New Brunswick, Canada, to Norfolk Co., Ontario. Her
father and mother, John and Cynthia (Leeman) Underhill, Elnathan 1st, and wife Hannah (Brower) traveled in a caravan of
at least 2 covered wagons, and they followed a new road that had been cut through the forest along the north bank of the St.
Lawrence River. Little Martha rode most of the time in the lead wagon with her grandmother. Martha had golden ringlets
and blue eyes. She inherited them from her grandfather, Elnathan, who was of English descent. She looked forward to the
evenings when they stopped traveling, and built a fire. She loved the taste of flapjacks that her mother and grandmother
baked in the skillet over an open fire. When they had fish for supper, the flapjacks were made from corn meal. When they
broiled strips of venison on willow sticks over the coals, the flapjacks were made with wheat flour. Sometimes they had
honey. After many long days of travel, they knew that they were near Lake Erie, and Point Ryerse. They were going to live
near John&#x27;s Aunt Sarah and her husband, Col. Samuel Ryerse. They watched for a break in the sugar maple and black walnut
trees, then glimpsed a large white house. It was 2 stories high and had
many windows. It was situated on a high bank,
and overlooked Lake Erie. Beside the house, a stream cut through the fields and empties into the lake. They soon settled in a
home of their own near the village of Waterford, not far from Simcoe, the county seat of Norfolk County. The local Baptist
church was an ideal place to meet new neighbors. At church she became attracted to a young man who had dark hair, and
eyes that sparkled when he laughed. Friendship blossomed into romance. That young man, Nathaniel Dennis, and Martha
were married in March 1835 in the little church where they had met. She was 15 years old, which was common practice in
those pioneer days. They settled on a farm in nearby Walsingham Township. They lived there for about 18 years, and had 9
children. When Louisa was born, (1853), Martha died. Six months later Louisa died. They were buried on their farm.
Nathaniel erected a beautiful marble tombstone at their graves with their names and dates engraved on it. Nathaniel
certainly must have been broken hearted from losing his dear Martha at the age of 33.</div>
