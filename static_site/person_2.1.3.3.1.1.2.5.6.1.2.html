January 20, 2007, Pilgrim United Church of Christ, Grafton WI – Eulogy by James Litton to his Grandpa, James T. Ferris
My Grandfather might have been many things to many people. Father, brother, husband, friend, engineer, soldier, mentor,
photographer, artist, boxer, investor, deacon, and inventor. He was the model family man and citizen. But, as a young
person growing up, I would have had a hard time describing him as any of these things. To me (pause), he was the dreamer,
the “doer” and above all else, the story teller. PBS, Sesame Street, and Mr. Rogers had nothing on my Grandfather’s ability
to capture my attention as an adolescent. He and I logged in countless hours at each of his many workshops, usually talking
more than working. He spoke with a slow grace, matched only by the likes of James Earl Jones. Watching my facial
expressions change with each twist and turn of his tales, he lit a match under my imagination every lazy afternoon we spent
together.
My Grandfather the dreamer loved the idea of flying. At the breakfast table in Lexington, he would listen to my
early morning rants about transformers, monsters and baseball. I would ask, “What do you dream about Grandpa?” With
ease, he would say, “flying… Soaring with the birds. My arms spread out and I danced on the treetops.” This went on for
several years. I would have nightmares and he would recount his latest dream of flying. Finally, one day I decided to ask, “if
you like flying so much, how come you always drive to the PL every year?” He and Grandma laughed and I joined in. I
didn’t know why it was funny; I just thought it would have been faster.
I should clarify one point regarding my Grandfather’s dreaming. His dreams of flying were confined to sleeping
and napping. While, during the day, we were all free to observe his dreams come to life. My wife often wonders where I get
my tendency to come up with some lovable, yet hair brained schemes. Well, I have to attribute this one to you Grandpa.
This is the man who planned to create a poison ivy killing machine so that we could all be rid of that three leaved devil. He
had an old lawnmower that looked more like a Mid-evil torture device rather than something used for lawn-care. He and I
sat over plans for months until we decided to cut the machine up with a hacksaw and mailed it to the PL. We agreed that we
would need to spend at least a summer perfecting the “P.I. Dragon.” I don’t think it ever got out of the box once it arrived in
Wisconsin, but the dream certainly stayed alive. This was not the first nor the last time my Grandfather and I would let our

imaginations get the better of us. There was the time our neighbors put their broken down swimming pool ladder in the
trash. To some this might have been just another piece of junk. To Grandpa and I, this was just the excuse we needed to
spend countless hours with our favorite hardware man and Time Life home repair books. You should have seen the look on
my Grandmother’s and Mother’s faces. It was the proverbial, “Here we go again!” Models of Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer,
we allowed one another’s logic to leap frog reality. “Hey look at that!” he exclaimed as we turned the corner. “Yeah!” I
exclaimed, not yet knowing what we would do with it. “Well, you can’t have a pool without a ladder!” Truer words could
not have been said to my nine year old ears. And within half an hour we were in the backyard, planning, scheming, and
giggling with joy as we gazed at our newest project. At dinner, Grandpa told Grandma and Mom our plans to use fine cuts
of redwood and cedar to fix the plastic and metal pool ladder. Mom choked a little on her “Wendy stew,” trying to hold
down her laughter as much as possible. Grandma, staring into what was going to be our latest summer debacle, said, “I’d
rather you just build a wooden space ship and get it all over with.” I am sure with all these adventures into the impossible
my Grandfather’s goal was never to add to his list of numerous patents or to relive his days at Bausch and Lomb. He wanted
to foster the life of another dreamer. He wanted to see someone else touch the stars and lives of others, an art he redefined
everyday.
John Tomlinson Ferris “the Doer” was not the accomplished professional this title might seemingly describe. He
was most certainly accomplished in every professional task he undertook, but “the Doer” was one who paid attention to
little things. As a child I watched with great impatience as my Grandfather fixed a wooden airplane my Uncle made when
he was eight; he returned every single shopping cart he ever used to the front of the store; he catalogued his LP record
collection numerically, alphabetically and then &#x27;Bettically&#x27; (i.e. from most to least important as it related to his love for
Grandma… In my heart of hearts I think this was done just to get her to dance when no one else was around.) I did not
understand why he took such care with every task. Just as some people watch their checkbooks like hawks, my Grandfather
guaranteed that every action he took moved the world towards a better place. Karma is a heavy thing for an adolescent to
understand. I was truly lucky to know someone living and loving as if the Golden Rule was something more than just an old
playground standard. My most favorite example of this type of behavior was when I was a teenager, living with Grandpa
and Grandma in Lexington. I was downstairs, studying for my High School Freshman year final exams, when I heard
several voices. One was Grandpa, the other two I had never heard before. I looked out the window… no cars. The voices
were younger… hmmm… there was no way my friends had come over. I suddenly got worried. I yelled up the stairs, “you
ok up there?!” “Sure thing James,” My Grandfather’s voice exclaimed. “I’m just listening to these Gentlemen’s theory about
how Jesus took a little Vacation in North America.” It hit me like a ton of bricks. Grandpa invited two of the local traveling
Mormons, on their mission, to come in for tea and conversation. He had no intention of converting, but had no reason turn
them away either. Not only was he up for religious conversation, he wanted to extend his hand in friendship to those
individuals more accustomed to having doors slammed in their face by the majority of yuppies in the old New England
town. I am not sure I would do the same thing if presented with this situation in the future, but I do believe there is
something to be learned from his undying kindness and curiosity.
Grandpa the storyteller was most certainly the main event. His top ten hits were known as:
The time Great Grandpa beat up a drunk for cursing Jesus in a barber shop
The Butler farm and all its endless supply of watermelons
The bombing of his bunker in Moriti
The Mighty proposal on Gibraltar Rock
The ins and outs of Radar school and how Private Ferris learned to love Basic training and army cheese
The triumph of Son John in leading creating the Lexington High School wrestling team
The mighty kick of the cat heard round the world AKA Grandma’s first trip to the PL in her early morning slumber, kick the
family cat out of the tent.
The “army boxing champ” known as Submarine
Eating Pancakes on the war ship and cheering the appearance of the Golden Gate bridge
And last but not least, my favorite
The ever victorious malleable tales of Cowboy James
Cowboy James was the protagonist in every moral lesson. They usually started with Cattle wrestling, a phrase I tool all too
literally until he explained that it was stealing cows. Then they moved into more serious territory. My Grandfather had just
gotten out of hospital, recovering from knee replacement, and would ride his stationary bike. I would be next to him on the

rocking horse my uncle John handcrafted for me as Christmas present. He had his horse and I had mine. Later in life I
learned that he was telling me about his own life. The time Cowboy James and his best friend ran into trouble with an axe in
the woods of the PL; that was my Grandfather and Uncle Harlo were chopping wood as young boys and Granpa’s finger
was in the way. The time Cowboy James had a wagon fall on his arm; he was explaining what happened when an engine
motor fell on his hand in the south pacific. When Cowboy James moved to Houston and sent for his bride to be; this was
Grandpa telling me the “ins and outs” of how to convince a woman to plan a wedding and marry you within one month’s
time. (I think I missed the message here, maybe he was trying to get me to utilize the fine institution of Las Vegas, I am not
sure) Grandpa the storyteller never needed special effects, loud noises, or explicit content to capture the listener. Rather, his
fables were filled with enough exciting reality to interest both the patient listener and excitable youngster alike.
To conclude her heart felt eulogy of my Grandmother, my mother exclaimed, “we are not mad at you Momma,
we love you and will keep loving you forever.” To my Grandfather I say, “You got the story of life right, Grandpa. Your’s is
a tale we will never stop telling.”
