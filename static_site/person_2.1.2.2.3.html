            <div class="person-text">(2.1.2.2.3) ELIZABETH WEED born May 16, 1736 Stamford and died January 31, 1840 (1815? which
seems more realistic); married February 7, 1760 at Stamford, Gideon Hait (#2901) (4.6.5.5) who was
baptized March 20, 1736/7 and died July 26, 1801 Greenfield, Saratoga, NY; a Revolutionary War
veteran. They resided in “old Poundridge” in 1773 and up to the time of the revolution; afterward
removed to Greenfield, Saratoga, NY and were buried there. See him for offspring.</div>
