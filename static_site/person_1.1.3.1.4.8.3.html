            <div class="person-text">(1.1.3.1.4.8.3) LOUISE MARY BLAKENEY born October 4, 1867 Brooklyn NY
[where her parents were residing on Sackett Street between Smith Street and Hoyt
Street]; graduated from Brooklyn High School 1885; after a few months she secured a
position in Public School No. 11 on Roosevelt Street, NYC. Here she taught until her
marriage, September 16, 1891 to William John Fisher [son of William Barnes &amp; Jane
(Chambers) Fisher] born April 24, 1859 Liverpool, England and died October 3, 1924
Hackensack NJ. Upon her marriage, they moved to Hackensack NJ, taking a house on
Passaic Street. After joining Christ Church (Episcopal), she became a member of the
Guild of the Parish, the Guild of the Good Shepherd, and the Hackensack Hospital
Association. During the Spanish-American War she worked on the Red Cross
Committee, and until the birth of her daughter Elizabeth, was an active member in
church and hospital organizations. In 1898, they built a new home on Clinton Place.
During WWI she worked with Mrs. David St. John’s Red Cross Committee, making
bandages and dressings for the Allied troops. When the US declared war she worked
with Red Cross Unit No. 8. With the entire class she took the examination for
instructress in surgical dressings, and was appointed an Inspectress. For 2 years she was
vice president of the Ladies’ Auxiliary of Harry B. Doremus Post, American Legion,
with which body she served on the Hospital committee. On the death of William she
moved from Hackensack to Maywood. She was a member of the Women’s Missionary
Club; a charter member of the Women’s club of Hackensack, and a member of the
Hackensack Golf Club and Hackensack Dramatic Club and other organizations. William
was about 7 years old when his parents come to the US and settled in Brooklyn. He
found it necessary to leave school when very young and go to work, but being naturally
of a studious nature he continued his studies by attending night school. After holding
several positions he became an accountant with Thompson &amp; Bedford Company, dealers
in lubricating oils, which firm later was absorbed by the Standard Oil Company, when

Mr. Thompson retired, but Mr. E. T. Bedford soon became one of the important
members of the original Standard Oil group and finding it necessary to have a person of
undoubted integrity to handle his personal finances, he selected William, who held that
position until his death. In 1912, E. T. Bedford retired from active participation in the
affairs of the Standard Oil Co., to devote his time and energy to the management of the
Corn Products Co., of which he was President, and at his request, William resigned his
position and became Assistant Treasurer of the Corn Products Co., his principal duties
being, however, the care of Mr. Bedford’s personal finances. William became a member
of the Board of Directors and of the Executive Committee of the People’s Trust &amp;
Guaranty Co., of Hackensack NJ and a member of the Board of Directors of the North
River Insurance Co., of NYC. He resided in Brooklyn until 1891, when, with his mother
and brother, he removed to Hackensack NJ, where he made his permanent home. While
in Brooklyn, he was a member of All Saints Episcopal Church and on his removal to
Hackensack, he joined Christ Church, where he served on the vestry and as Junior
Warden, and at the time of his death was Senior Warden and Treasurer, which positions
he had held for a number of years. While he was of a retiring and reserved disposition,
he made hosts of friends and was always ready to do an act of kindness or help in any
undertaking for the benefit of the church or the community. Born to them were:</div>
