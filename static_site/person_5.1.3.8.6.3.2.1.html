            <div class="person-text">(5.1.3.8.6.3.2.1) ETHEL SALOME PECK born March 17, 1884 Lake View IA; married October 26,
1905 Idaho Falls ID, Barzilla Worth Clark [son of Joseph Addison &amp; Eunice (Hadley) - Indiana State
Quaker settlers] born December 22, 1881 Hadley IN and died September 21, 1943 Idaho Falls ID.
Barzilla moved with his parents in 1885 to Eagle Rock, now called Idaho Falls, having made the trip
from Indiana via narrow gauge railroad. In addition to attending public schools in Idaho Falls, Barzilla
returned to Indiana where he attended Rose Polytechnic Institute in Terre Haute; when ill health forced
him to cut short his education, he returned to Idaho and engaged in farming, mining and cattle raising.
Barzilla was a civil engineer and earl became interested in conservation and the development of natural
resources, particularly irrigation and hydroelectric projects in Idaho. The government later purchased
his reservoir at the headwaters of the Blackfoot River and his plan for impounding Lost River was
merged into the Mackay Dam. After serving two terms as councilman, he was elected mayor of Idaho
Falls in 1913 (1913-16). During this term the city built the municipal hydroelectric plant No. 1, located
just below the Broadway Bridge. Following a period of interest in central Idaho mines, he was again
elected mayor in 1927 and continued in that office until he was inaugurated as governor of Idaho in
January 1937. At the expiration of his single term as governor in 1939 he returned to Idaho Falls and
the development of his personal interests there. Ethel was active in the work of Trinity Methodist
Church, Idaho Falls and in the WFMS in that region. Born to them were:</div>
