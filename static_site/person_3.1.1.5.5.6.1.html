have since lived. James’ mother having died Dec. 15, 1850 (she left three children), Oct. 21, 1851, his
father married Mrs. Catherine Early, of Sangamon Co.; he still survives and now, at the ripe age of 74,

resides with James, who is a prominent farmer and stock-dealer. His farm consists of 166 acres of fine
land, adjoining the town of Petersburg. His wife was Miss Anna Smith, of this county; they were
married Jan. 5, 1845, and have a family now living of five children. Mr. Miles is one of the well-to-do
and enterprising farmers of Menard Co., always assisting in such matters as pertain to the welfare of
the community. (1905) James Miles born in White county, Illinois on the 25th of November 1822, and
is a son of George Uriah and Jane (McCoy) Miles. His father born March 20, 1796 in St. Mary county,
Maryland, and on coming to Illinois in 1815 he settled in White county, where he married on the 18th
of November, 1821 to Miss Jane McCoy. She born in Greenbrier County, West Virginia, November 11,
1796. In November 1825, George U. Miles removed to Sangamon County, Illinois, and settled on a
farm six miles north of Springfield, where he engaged in farming and stock raising for a number of
years. He often drove stock to Chicago, that being his nearest market. On one of these trips to Chicago,
he was offered eighty acres of land in the swamp there for a horse, that tract being now in the very
heart of the business part of the city. His wife died December 15, 1850, and he passed away at the
home of his son James near Petersburg on the 19th of March 1882, lacking one day of being eighty-six
years of age. Having removed with his parents to Sangamon county James Miles lived in that county
until he was grown, and later removed to Menard County, where on the 5th of January 1845, he was
joined in marriage to Miss Anna Smith, born in the state of New York, December 3, 1823. To this union
were born six children, namely: Mrs. Mary Jane Hurd; Mrs. Lizzie N. Wood; a son who died in
infancy; George Uriah, Jr.; James S., who married Nellie Purkapile; and Mrs. Katie A. Gray. Mrs. Hurd
has one living daughter, Mrs. Iona A. Peterson, whose two-year-old son, Myron Dale, is Mr. Miles’
only great grandchildren. Mrs. Wood has two daughters and one son, and James S. Miles has a son and
a daughter, those constituting the grandchildren of our subject. James Miles continues to reside on the
old homestead one mile from Petersburg, where he has lived for forty-eight years. He and his wife, at
the ages of eighty-two and eighty-one years respectively, are both hale and hearty, and in a few months
they will have traveled the road of life together for sixty years. An industrious and temperate life has
borne its fruit in a healthy and happy old age for both of them. Having acquired a competency in earlier
life, they are spending a quiet and serene old age, enjoying the love and gratitude of their children and
the respect and confidence of all who know them. Partial Obit: AThe venerable James Miles, one of
Menard county&#x27;s oldest and most beloved citizens, passed from this life Tuesday, 11th instant, at 2:00
o&#x27;clock a.m., at the homestead one mile north of the city, which was his home for almost fifty-eight
years. Uncle Jim, as he was affectionately called by almost the entire community, has passed his
ninetieth year but his mind was clear and his eye undimmed and until within the last few weeks he was
seen on the streets of Petersburg almost daily. We shall miss him.
&quot;The Story of Anna Smith&quot;, written by Beulah M. Wood as a school assignment:
&quot;In the days following our second war with England, when the young American republic was
thrilled with the spirit of nationalization, and the test of that patriotic fervor was the glory of economic
conquest through emigration, the subject of this paper Anna Smith, then a tiny child of eight years,
moved with her parents from the center of life and culture of New York City into the territory of
Illinois.
Anna&#x27;s father Alvin Smith was a college man; [his] mother was the daughter of Rheuben Ferris,
pastor and leader of the noted Fairfield Conn. Baptist Church. Caught in the tide of the emigration
movement the father decided to cast his fortune with it, and therewith took his family, and traveled by

wagon route to the head waters of the Allegheny River near the present city of Olean to what was then
a logging center known among the few whites and Indians as Painted-Post. Here the family lived for
almost six months in camp while the father and brother, who by the way was a man with a family of
equal proportion -- a family of eight children, built a flatboat. Indians were no curiosity in those days.
Anna Smith remembered long after and related the story to her grandchildren of one old Indian who sat
on the banks of the river and watched the men build their boat. He was friendly to the men and tried to
play with the little girl, but she was too shy to appreciate his best intentions and was quite content to
allow him to fish and talk to her father. It was in the early spring when the boat was finished and the
two families embarked on their long river journey. They floated down the Allegheny to the Ohio
stopping here and there on the trip to look for suitable game or desirable land on which to make their
homes. They depended almost entirely upon the game they killed for their supply of food. With a
family of twenty mouths this part of the providing was by no means a part that was without its cares
and difficulties. For weeks they floated down the river then they came to the Mississippi River and
turned north because they had heard of the prairie soil of the Illinois territory and they wanted to look
at it. They worked their way up the Mississippi and turned in at the Illinois River coming to the
present site of Beardstown. They decided to stay here for by this time it was late fall and the snow was
again falling. The two Smith brothers left their families at the landing in the care of a generous hearted
family, and they hastened out into the open land out beneath the shelter of the bluffs and close to the
trees, which grew along the river and set about building a rude log cabin. They were advised to build
near the river for two reasons, the game kept close to water and then too the presence of the trees made
a shelter from the wind and snow both of which the early settlers found to be their hardest elements to
overcome since their housing conditions were crude at the best. After due time the cabin was
completed and the families moved in -- twenty strong. The cabin was about 14x15 feet square with a
loft the access to which was a ladder. The first floor being too small to contain all twenty at one time
with any degree of physical comfort the children were sent to bed with an early supper and the ladder
was taken down to prevent their return to the cabin&#x27;s first floor. The little eight year old girl who later
became an enthusiastic story teller to her grandchildren concerning these pioneer days said that many a
time they used to peep through the hole in the floor to listen to the hunting stories of the grown up folk
and many a time they were sent back to their beds for so doing. The snow often sifted through the roof
and chinking and they found themselves covered with a new white counterpane in the morning.
There were no advantages for education so the father of Anna undertook to teach the children
their lessons for it had been one great drawback toward their coming west when he and his wife
thought of the loss of school advantages to their children. He set aside certain times in the day for
study and recitation. Before long one of the neighbors came in and interrupted the recitation and when
he went to leave he asked Alvan Smith to teach his children too. Mr. Smith already had a school as it
was but he took in his friend&#x27;s children because he felt under obligation to him since he had assisted
him to build the cabin when he most needed help. Then and there the trouble began. Other neighbors
wanted in and after some arrangements the plans were at length completed. The work at first was
without compensation but later they built a little room near the Smith cabin which was used for a shed
to shelter the Smith tools and serve as a place to meet the pupils since the Smith cabin could scarcely
contain its own brood with any comfort. The children brought meal and meat and all sorts of eatables

to pay their tuition but the amount and the kind was altogether their own choosing. So far as is known
this Alvan Smith is the first teacher in what is now Menard County. He was later pressed into service
as a minister and used to make a circuit through what is now Cass and Menard Counties.
We cannot close this paper without a word as to the help his dainty little helpmate gave in this
work. She was a thrifty, economic little woman in stature not five feet tall, but with a heart that was
full of strong purpose. She had been reared to have many of the luxuries of life, one of which was
soda. One may smile at this but nevertheless one of the luxuries of colonial housekeeping was soda.
Now that she was removed from the center of life where she could get this she was determined to have
it if she could. Therefore she used to save all the corncobs and from these she made her coveted soda
and boasted to her family that the president&#x27;s wife could not make better soda biscuits than she. She
used to sift the coarse mill corn meal and wheat meal through cheesecloth and then on Sundays she
made a white loaf and had a Johnnycake for the children. She was gifted with a good singing voice and
in the long evenings during the winter especially she sang, and taught her children to sing the songs she
had learned in her life back east.
This couple took up land from the government made the most of their opportunities lived a life
full of definite service to their community and at length died without an amassed fortune but they gave
to their children a something that was better than land, they gave them a chance to see life in its fullest
sense.@
Obit for Anna: &quot;Mrs. Anna Miles, wife of James Miles, one of Menard county&#x27;s oldest citizens and one
of its most lovable and beloved women, passed away at the family residence just north of this city,
about seven o&#x27;clock last Sunday morning, 9th inst., at the advanced age of 82 years, 9 months and 6
days.
She was the daughter of Alvin and Cynthia Smith and born in Tompkins County, New York,
December 3, 1823; nine years old she came with her parents to Illinois. January 5, 1845, in this county,
she was united in marriage with James Miles. For several years they resided west of Petersburg, then
lived in town for a time, removing to the farm north of town in the early part of 1856, where they lived
happily together for more than fifty years. Six children were born to them. Five are living, and reside
near Petersburg, namely: Mary, wife of A. G. Hurd; Lizzie, wife of H. A. Wood; George U. Miles;
James S. Miles; and Kate A., wife of A. S. Gray, all of whom, with her aged companion, mourn the lost
of a faithful, loving and devoted wife and mother.
When about fourteen years of age she united with the Methodist church, of which she was a
faithful member until death. She was an ardent temperance worker and for some years was president of
the local branch of the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union.
The funeral occurred from the home at 2 o&#x27;clock Monday afternoon, and was attended by many
friends. The services were conducted by her pastor, Rev. Silas N. Wakefield, assisted by Elder W. M.
Groves. The interment was made in Oakland Cemetery.&quot; (Petersburg IL)
