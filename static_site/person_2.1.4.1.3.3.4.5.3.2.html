            <div class="person-text">(2.1.4.1.3.3.4.5.3.2) JAMES STEPHEN FERRIS (Photograph) born Februray 27, 1931 Osakis MN
and died May 3, 1985; buried Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery, San Antonio TX (photo); Section
1, Site 367; SMSGT; married October 7, 1950 in Osakis Patricia June Rutten [dau of Joseph John &amp;
Gladys Viola (Eastman) Rutten] born January 8, 1930 Osakis. In Scott’s words: “Enlisted in the US Air
Force during the Korean Conflict February 1951; went to Communications School at Warren AFB,
Cheyenne, WY; from there he was stationed at Scott AFB near St. Louis. In 1954 he was re-assigned to
Newfoundland, Canada. Notice the time frame; mom said that he was home long enough to make
babies and then was gone on remote assignments. After his tour in Newfoundland he was assigned to
Brooks AFB, San Antonio, Tx (Security Service). In 1959 he went to Japan and later followed. My
mother (bless her heart) had 4 little boys (under the age of six) and was expecting another. We stayed in
Japan until our return in 1962. His next assignment took us to northeastern Arkansas to Blytheville
AFB. This was a SAC base with B52&#x27;s and KC-135 tankers. We were there to witness the mass takeoffs
of the entire base wing during the Cuban War Crisis. Impressive and scary. The next change of station
came in 1964; back to San Antonio the family went, and he went to Libya, Africa. In 1966 he put in for
San Antonio and was assigned to Lackland AFB (his only assignment outside of his career field). In
late 1968 he received orders to go to Torrejon AFB, Madrid, Spain. He left, and we stayed until school
was out in the summer of 1969. Again, my mother traveled with 6 kids from San Antonio to Madrid.
Everyone enjoyed this tour; the Spanish were nice people and there was no drinking age laws that
prohibited teenagers from getting into trouble!!!! You could always tell the new kids, they were the
ones with the hangovers!!!! My older brother and I returned to the states in the summer of 1971; Greg
to start college, and I to finish my last year of high school. The family came back in March of 1972 to
San Antonio, Tx. where my dad retired and we finally settled in. He never talked about his work in the
military, we were not allowed togo to his work site because of the classified equipment and documents.
He was often away on TDY&#x27;s to Iran, Libya, Turkey and who knows where else. We later found out
there was a lot of embassy work. My dad gained a passion for clocks in Spain, started his collection

and after his retirement from the military, started his clock business. He worked at this until his death in
1985”. Born to them were:</div>
