            <div class="person-text">(1.1.4.4.1.3.6) ANNICE AMELIA MOFFAT (Photo) born July 2, 1862/61 Necedah,
Juneau, WI and died January 20, 1927 Barron Co WI, after a lengthy illness; buried
there in the Christeson Family Plot in Wayside Cemetery; (Mittie) married December
25, 1882 at the Quarderer House, a hotel in Barron WI, Simon Christeson [son of
Christen &amp; Marie (Olson) Christenson] born March 22, 1855 Gulbrandalen, Norway and
died February 5, 1930 Barron; buried with his wife. After their marriage, Simon became
manager of the Quarderer House and later purchased the establishment. They eventually
built a residence in Barron and Simon also owned a 160-acre farm in Maple Grove

Township, which later was owned by his sons Raymond and Clifford and a 100-acre
farm in Arland Township, which became the property of his son Lester. Both farms were
located in Barron County. Simon applied for naturalization and received his citizenship
papers in 1887. In the 1900 Census, Simon is listed as a lumber inspector living in
Barron. In the 1910 Census, Simon is listed as a farmer living in Barron. From The
Shield, Barron, June 24, 1881: Simon Christeson while engaged last week in chopping in
two a tree which had blown over on his place in Clinton, narrowly escaped a free but
rather undesirable ride, arrow-like through the air. He was standing about 16 feet from
the root of the tree, with one foot on either side of his chip, and while yet a number of
inches were uncut, the tree suddenly snapped in two at his chopping, and the stump end
of the log, accompanied by one half of Simon, started sky-ward; and only for the
objection of the other half, which finally (!) prevailed, bringing him down with
considerable force upon an unoffending hip and arm, it is likely that he would be going
yet. Simon nursed his bruises for a couple of days, and then returned to his work
resolved to chop another like log with a saw. Simon was affiliated with the M. E. Church
and Barron Lodge No. 35, I.O.O.F., of which he was a charter member. Born to them
