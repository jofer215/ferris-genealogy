            <div class="person-text">(2.6.3.5.1.4.2) CHARLES TODD QUINTARD (Photo) born December 22, 1824 Stamford and died
February 15, 1898 Meridian GA; graduated with a M.D., U. of New York 1846, having been a student

of Dr. Valentine Mott. After spending a few months in the Bellevue Hospital, and as physician to the
New York City Dispensary, he removed to Athens, Georgia. There he soon won reputation in his
profession and as a medical writer, and in 1851, he was called to the chair of physiology and anatomy
in the Memphis Medical College. Devoting himself, meanwhile, also, to theological studies, under the
direction of Bishop Otey of Tennessee, in 1855 he was admitted to orders. At once, he entered on the
rectorship of Calvary Church, Memphis, from which he went, in 1858, to the church of the Advent,
Nashville. Under his successful ministry of four years, this church advanced from thirty-six to about
three hundred communicants. At the beginning of the Civil War he was appointed Chaplain of the
1st Tennessee Regiment, and he so continued during the War, in addition to his duties being frequently
called upon to act as physician and surgeon. His progress in his new profession was rapid, as in that of
medicine, and in 1866 he received his D.D. from Columbia; was chosen Bishop of Tennessee
September 7, 1865; L.L.D from Cambridge, England 1867. He married October 19, 1848 in Roswell
GA, Eliza Catherine Head born February 2, 1826 – plenty of info on the ‘Net on this guy</div>
