shipworks, NYC headed by William Webb. He resided in Ossining, NY and was a naval engineer;

Constructing engineer and fleet engineer of Russian Fleet in Chinese waters. In August 1860 he
resigned his position in Russian Navy to offer his services to the United States Navy. Aug. 14, 1861
appointed 1st assistant engineer in United States Navy. Aug. 23, 1861 appointed first assistant engineer
on gunboat Unadilla. While taking this vessel to Hilton Head the engine broke down. He repaired them

the Lackawanna. Next he was sent out on Lackawanna as chief engineer in the blockade off Mobile;
iick with Southern fever; ordered home on sick leave; on special duty at Brooklyn Navy Yard. He

Next Mr. Marsland was sent as chief engineer of the Colorado, to Pacific coast, as a chief engineer in

-Cora Marsland letter to VLR(?) May 1939 &quot;Through the influence of William H. Webb, ship builder,
he was appointed first assistant engineer of the Italian frigate Re Luigi de Portogallo (that had just been
built) on its trip to Italy. In August of 1867, at the insistance of Mr. John Roach, he was engaged to take
the ironclad ram, Dunderborg, (which the government of the U.S. had just sold to France) to the port of
Cherbourg, France. Mr. Marsland was then for two years the chief engineer of the Essayons dredging
the lower Mississipi River. He was then directed by the U.S. government to make drawings for another
dredge (the General Mcallister) and to go to New York City to superintend its construction. About this
time John Roach bought the iron works at Chester, PA and induced Mr. Marsland to resign from the
government engineering corps and become superintending engineer of his establishment. He remained
in this position more than three years during which time the City of Sydney and the City of New York
were built. Then he became inspector of steamers for the Port of New York. He crossed the Indian
Ocean twice, the Atlantic 99 times and the Pacific 5 times. From the Orient and Italy, France and
England, he came home laden with treasures of art. Owing to impaired health, he returned to his estate
that commanded an unusually beautiful view of the Hudson River. From 1893-1898, the last years of
his life, he had his first respite from arduous work and grave responsibility. Of such stuff heroes are
made. He died June 1898.&quot; - Cora Marsland letter to Sarah Marsland Sammis. Born to them was:</div>
