            <div class="person-text">(3.1.1.6.2.3.1.7) JOHN HOWARD FERRIS born August 2, 1853/54 Linwood OH and died there
December 1929; as a small lad, without the knowledge of his parents, he entered into a contract to sell
newspapers as train-boy, in order to raise funds for some ambitious project. That covert, but successful
enterprise was in reality John&#x27;s first step in his destined career of success; graduated with honors at
Denison University OH 1876; for the next two years, he held the position of principal of Norwood
Schools; graduated from the Cincinnati Law School 1879, and at once entered into partnership with
Judge Cowan, one of his legal tutors. This partnership was dissolved about ten years later and he
formed a second with Judge James B. Swing, which continued for two years, when John, having been
elected probate judge for the county by the overwhelming plurality of 9,000 votes - more than 2,000

duties of his new office. He was reelected, 1893, by a majority of 15,000 votes. He was president of
the Ohio State Association of Probate Judges; later, Judge, Superior Court, Hamilton Co OH; married
September 25, 1883/84 Frances M. Arthur (Fannie), of Cincinnati, born August 1, 1863 and died
October 18, 1943; and born to them were:</div>
