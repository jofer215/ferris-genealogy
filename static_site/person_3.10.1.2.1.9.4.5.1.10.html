and a little farther south to the buildings. Going west from Mervin &amp; Olive&#x27;s place is Highway # 14 that
runs into Greene to the right and into Allison to the left. Most of the roads are blacktopped now,
whereas Raymond Darby remember when on the Wygle farm, none of the &quot;side roads&quot; were hard
surfaced, they were all crushed rock &amp; gravel.” “Mervin Darby, 92, of Clarksville, died Monday, Nov.

services Thursday; Mr. Darby farmed until his retirement.” FROM LUTHER LOUCKS &quot;HISTORY
OF THE KEILLORS, CRANDALLS, HUNTS, &amp; LOUCKS&quot; &quot;Olive was always pretty, gracious and
industrious. She was well liked by all that knew her and was a true friend. Her younger sister Mary Lou
was a constant companion, as they became a little older. Olive took music lessons at McPhail School of
Music and got her teaching degree, which she was able to use to good advantage as she taught many
students over a period of many years. After finishing High School at Central High School in
Minneapolis and Business College, she got a job at &quot;Butler Brothers&quot;, a wholesale furniture house in
Minneapolis. In 1941 Olive was married to Mervin Darby who had purchased the Darby Farm from his
fathers&#x27; estate. Olive did well at the many duties of a good and faithful farm wife. She became the
mother of two bright children, 8 grandchildren and 6 great-grandchildren. Olive and Mervin have
always been most hospitable and continue to be so in their &quot;retirement&quot; home, which is close to their
farm, which they still own and lease out. They both have been such a help in the local meeting there,
and helped organize the annual Bible Conference starting in 1949. It continues on as the largest Bible
conference in the Fellowship. &quot;</div>
