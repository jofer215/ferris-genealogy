It’s a small world – note from Merrily, granddaughter of Walter, noting the connection with
the Knox County Ferris’.
”I grew up in Carson City, no direct line from the early Ferris settlers. My &quot;Ferris&quot; mother was from
Portland. I was born in Reno because during WWII private aviation was restricted within 200 miles of
the West Coast. My dad was managing 3 airports in Calif. when the war broke out. He ended up in
Reno around 1943 after spending a year up in Northern Calif. (Beckworth) fighting fires. He dropped
supplies to the fire fighters. These fires were started by Japanese hot air, &quot;explosive&quot; balloons which
descended on our forests. That information came out after my father passed away; he didn&#x27;t know how
those fires were started, but he had plenty of fires that season up in the Trinity Range. The rest of the
War he was chief pilot of a Navy flight training program in Ely, Nevada (on the East). He and my
mother married in 1936. So she spent the war years in Reno, as a weather station person at the Reno
Airport. She drew weather charts and made predictions, sending up the weather balloons and so
forth. My sister and I were born after the war ended, in 1949 and 1950. So we were born in Reno and
moved to Carson City in 1960, when I turned 10. My father started a flight training school in the

Carson Valley - Agricultural Aviation Academy, located at the Minden Airport. So if you connect the
dots with the research on the Carson Valley Ranchers...the Dangberg Family in particular, there is a
relationship between the flight School and the Dangberg family. They needed their alfalfa crops
sprayed for aphids, and my father (who was one of the first 50 crop dusters in the U.S.) did this for
them when he first started the Academy. In return, the Dangberg &quot;okayed&quot; the use of their large fields
for aerial application training. In other words, the students and instructors were permitted to train off
the Dangberg property, which was the largest ranch in the Carson Valley. The Academy became the
largest flight training school in the world during the 1960&#x27;s and 1970&#x27;s. Students came from all over the
world to attend. But my father always had a very good relationship with the Dangberg family. In fact,
my first horse was from the Dangberg Ranch, an old mare who was a driving horse for the Ruth
Dangberg. We purchased her from the Achords...Ruth&#x27;s married name. The mare&#x27;s name was Rene.
(pronounced Reanie). As we know, horses go way back in our family tree... and continue to flow in our
veins. Then there is another link that I had not realized... my roommate in college was Hazel Rabe. Her
mother was Martha Schultz Rabe, also mentioned in this documention...the Schulz name. This was
also a large land holding between Carson City and Lake Tahoe. Interesting as it sounds... Carson City
(located in Eagle Valley) and the Carson Valley, the valley just to the South, was home to me for many
years. I passed the Ferris Mansion on my way to school, and never thought anything of it. Doug and I
were married in Genoa - in the Carson Valley, the oldest town in Nevada, historically known as
Morman Station. Our reception was in the second oldest structure in the State, now occupied by the
Pink House Restaurant. That ceremony took place 20 years ago and the Supreme Court Justice of the
time, Judge Mobray presided. My dad taught his sons to fly. My first job after receiving a bachelor&#x27;s
degree at University of Nevada, Reno, was for the Carson River Basin Council of Governments. That
agency studied the entire Carson River Basin, where George Washington Gale Ferris studied the water
wheel on the Carson River at Cradlebaugh Bridge, his early child hood memories that resulted in his
concept of a ride on a wheel.”</div>
