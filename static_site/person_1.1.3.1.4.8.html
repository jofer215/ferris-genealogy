            <div class="person-text">(1.1.3.1.4.8) BENJAMIN FERRIS BLAKENEY (Photo) born 1837 Peekskill NY and
died suddenly, in 1876, San Francisco CA, which place he had gone to prepare a
permanent home for his wife and family; buried in the Laurel Hill Cemetery (Defunct,
remains where relocated to various cemeteries?). When Benjamin was a young man, he
belonged to a Brooklyn debating society and a young man’s literary association, who
gave much of their time to forma and informal argument. He also wrote frequently for
the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, and a book having many of his poems, in his handwriting,
was owned by his daughter. When the Civil War broke out, he was unable to enlist
because of ill health and later an attack of inflammatory rheumatism left his heart
permanently affected. He was for some time in the insurance business, but later went in
partnership with his father-in-law, in the gold pen business. His inventions showed that
singular versatility of mind, which few men possess. He discovered the process of using
hydraulic pressure on paper to make papier mach containers. This idea he gave to the
Chicago Board of Trade, thus enabling him to spend all his spare time and money on the
perfection of a process by which erydium could be molded and applied to instruments
and tools having very fine points, making them more durable. When success in this
project seemed very near, his ill health and death prevented its culmination. His interest
in literature lasted during his life, and at times he entertained his friends by giving whole

scenes from the plays of Shakespeare. He married, April 29, 1862, Brooklyn NY, Stella
Peronne Sabin [dau of Henry Warren &amp; Lydia Ann (Northup) Sabin] who died January
16, 1908 Hackensack NJ at the home of her daughter, Adele; buried there. After
Benjamin’s death, Stella moved with her younger children to her parent’s home. Born to
them were:</div>
