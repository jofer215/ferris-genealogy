            <div class="person-text">(1.1.3.2.2) DAVID LENT FERRIS (Captain) born August 25, 1792/3 Kortright NY
and died December 21, 1854 Cortlandt NY. Captain Ferris was one of the picturesque
personages who captained his own market boat between Oscawana-on-Hudson and New
York City, back in the days when the Hudson was white with sails of market boats
carrying produce into the City. Three of the sons carried on the market boat business and
one of the trips to the metropolis, they were induced to take a chance on a lottery. They
hit the jackpot, won a considerable sum of money and proceeded to build a new house
across the road from the old one. After his retirement, the old Captain used to stand on
the hill by his house with a spyglass and watch for the sloops of his sons to enter the
Jemawisses Creek at Oscawana. Hence, Mr. Crosby Gaige, when he purchased the
place, decided to call it &#x27;Watch Hill&#x27;. He married Betsey Forgee (1798-1885) and born to
them were:
