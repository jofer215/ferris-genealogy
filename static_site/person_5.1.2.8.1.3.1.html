            <div class="person-text">(5.1.2.8.1.3.1) HELEN MAE FERRIS born October 5, 1836 Hinckley OH and died November 12,
1920; married 1860 at Oberlin OH, Charles G. Bisbee (Photo), a Congregational minister; may have
migrated to Alpena MI and onto Nebraska in 1866; he took charge of the Congregational Church at
Fontanelle NE and was the pastor there for a year; he and Mabel were the first teachers in the
Fontanelle academy which was the forerunner of Doane College, Crete; he writes*“You ask for
reminiscences in regard to the early history of Congregationalism in Nebraska. I am not one of the
pioneers. There were Congregational churches in Nebraska ten years before I came. I attended the
meeting of the State Association of Congregational Churches at Fontanelle in September 1866. The
ministeres and delegates attending that meeting were in all thirteen. None of them are now living but
myself. At that time I was elected stated clerk, and the minutes of the association were printed that year,
I think for the first time. At the same meeting I was elected a trustee of the Nebraska University, the
first school of high order which the Congregationalists of Nebraska undertook to sustain. At the
meeting of the board of trustees I was elected secretary of the board and clerk of the executive
committee. I kept the records of said institution while it lasted. Said records can be found among the
archives of Doane College.” *Congregational Nebraska, 1905</div>
