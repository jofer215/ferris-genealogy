Colonel Waterbury commanding, from May to December 1775 in the Canadian Campaign, under
Montgomery; and again, in 1776-77 in the Ninth Regiment. In 1778 he was Quartermaster under
Colonel Mead and the following year was appointed by Major General Putnam as Commander of the
vessel Wakeman and the whaler Ranger. In 1781 and 1782, he was a Lieutenant of the Coast Guards.
In 1802, he moved from CT to NY and purchased the Van Tassel estate, then known as Wolfert&#x27;s Roost,
