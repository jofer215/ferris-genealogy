            <div class="person-text">(3.10.1.2.1.9.4.5.1.1) SARAH FRANCES DARBY born July 26, 1890 Clarksville, Iowa and died there
1940; married December 31, 1913 at Nashua IA, Charles Cross born May 19, 1884 Plainfield, Iowa
and died November 1987, (103y?) Gwynn Oak, Maryland
Raymond Darby writes: &quot;We also heard about a &quot;Marie&quot; Cross, as children, probably Charlie&#x27;s sister,
but, she might have been Charlie&#x27;s Dad Fred&#x27;s sister. Charlie was born near Gramma Sutter&#x27;s farm in
Fremont Twp., just a quarter mile west and a half-mile south. When we were kids, there was a large
piece of tin, probably metal roofing that had blown onto Gramma Sutter&#x27;s farm near the back border.
They always said that had blown there in the 1919 &quot;Cyclone&quot;, from Marie Cross&#x27; farm buildings. There
was a picture in Katie Darby&#x27;s collection, probably taken at the Pleasant Valley Church where the
Sutter&#x27;s used to go, along with the Crosses, or possibly it was taken at the train station platform - hard
to tell in the photo. The photo shows Fred Cross, Charlie&#x27;s Dad, in the middle, with denim jacket &amp;
jeans. Next to him, Charlie&#x27;s mother, &amp; Charlie Cross. Rev. Van Loon also appears to be in the photo.
They may have been here to pick him up Rev. Van Loon, or see him off on a train? When they were in
Nashua we only knew Charlie&#x27;s parents, farmers living close to Gramma Sutter&#x27;s farm in Butler Co.
Charlie &amp; Fannie &amp; Family, lived at the end of the street that went by the Nashua Hall, and on the other
side lived Charlie&#x27;s parents. Charlie &amp; Fannie had an acreage and had a goat dairy, probably at least 20
goats in their herd.”</div>
