Ridge 1775 for 9 months and was involved in the taking of St. Johns, Canada and was honorably
discharged at Ticondergoa. Afterwards enlisted in Captain S. Delavan’s Company, Colonel Thomas
Thomas’ Regiment, 1778 and was taken prisoner and confined to the sugar-house in New York for 13
months. Apparently wounded during the skirmish. During his imprisonment, he was taunted by one of
his fellow townsmen, who was a Tory. When he was released from prison, instead of stopping to see
his family, he went several miles further to the house of his Tory friend. He called him out and after
giving him a sound threshing, he went home to see his family. He was an ensign in Captain Lewis’
Company, 4th Regiment April 12, 1782. Resided at Stamford, Greenwich, New York City; in 1815, he
resided in Cario, Greene County NY; in 1828, he resided in Pound Ridge NY. Nathan was a

and died October 21, 1841 age 82y; Nathan and Rhoda buried Pound Ridge Cemetery; married second,
Mary {mnu}. Born to Nathan and presumably, Rhoda, were [a son not listed below was Olford, who
was executor of Nathan’s will]:</div>
