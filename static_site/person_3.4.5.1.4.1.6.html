patient was confined to her room and was caused from cancer of the liver. Mrs. Ferris born at St. Louis [Missouri
according to the 1880 census, other census records said Wisconsin], May 31, 1844. She came with her parents to
Fond du Lac County in 1848 and was married at Lamartine January 24, 1859. With her husband she has been a
resident of this city for 16 years. She was a member of the First Baptist Church and was an untiring worker in all
of its activities. Besides her husband, she is survived by two sons and two daughters, Rev. E.E. [Elmer
Ellsworth] Ferris of LaCrosse; Rev. George H. Ferris of New Haven, Conn; Mrs. C. K. Avery of Merrill, and
Mrs. A. H. Adams of Port Townsend, Washington. Her two daughters were with her at the time of her death
having been here for several weeks. The sons are expected to arrive soon. The funeral will be held from the First

afternoon and Rev. G. H. Ferris of New Haven, Conn. will arrive tomorrow morning. After the funeral: The
funeral services were conducted by Rev. H. C. Miller. The casket was covered with flowers, showing in a
measure, something of the love and esteem in which Mrs. Ferris was held by her many friends.
On Tuesday December 9, 1913, this was written about George H. Ferris: George H. Ferris who has been ill for
some weeks and who went to Chicago last week is reported to be getting along nicely. He stood the trip to
Chicago well and is now able to be dressed and up most of the day. Mr. Ferris, who is 79 years old has made his
home in Fond du Lac County since he was 15 years of age and has lived in this city for the past 26 years. For the
past several years he has made his home at the Dewey house on East Second Street. He now makes his home

with his daughter, Mrs. A. H. Adams at 5524 Cornell Avenue, Chicago. Another daughter, Mrs. C. K. Avery
returned to Chicago today after being here to pack up her father&#x27;s good. His obituary appeared in the Daily
Commonwealth [FDL, WI] on Thursday, December 30, 1915: George H. Ferris, one of the well known pioneer
residents of Fond du Lac who took a great deal of interest and pride in the doing of the pioneer Fond du Lac
people, died at 6 a.m. this morning in Chicago where he has lived the past two years. Mr. Ferris has been in poor
health for some time and a telegram today announcing his death was not altogether unexpected by friends who
have continued in intimate friendship with him. Mr. Ferris was a prominent member of the Baptist Church, a
member of the Wisconsin assembly in 1887, and for many years was active in support of the republican party,
having taken active part for years in the conduct of local campaigns. He was deputy oil inspector for several
years and on retiring from that work went to Chicago to make his home with his daughter, Mrs. A. H. Adams.
Mr. Ferris born in St. George, Vermont in 1834 and came to his oft requested claim that he was one of the really
pioneer residents of Fond du Lac. Mr. Ferris kept a store in Lamartine for a good many years. He is survived by
two daughters, Mrs. Adams and Mrs. C. K. Avery of Chicago; two sons, Rev. George H. Ferris, Philadelphia and
Elmer Ferris, East Orange, New Jersey. The body is to be brought to this city Saturday for burial services.
Arrangements for the funeral and burial will be announced in more complete form later. Will arrive in this city
at 12:15 p.m. Saturday afternoon from Chicago and will be taken immediately to the Baptist Church for funeral
services. Burial will be taken to the Lamartine Cemetery.
