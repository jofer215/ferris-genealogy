            <div class="person-text">(1.1.1.7.3.4.2) ISAAC FERRIS LOCKWOOD (Photo) born February 23, 1855
Dubuque, Iowa and died March 10, 1927 New York City. From A Tribute, published by
The New York Public Library, 1927: Mr Lockwood, for many years Bursar of the
Library, died suddenly at his desk on the afternoon of Friday, March 10, after thirty-four
years’ service with the Library. He born in Dubuque, Iowa, on February 23, 1855, the
son of George Edward and Catherine (Burchan Ferris) Lockwood. He took his name
from his mother’s father, Rev Isaac Ferris, who was chancellor of New York University
from 1852 until his retirement in 1870 as chancellor emeritus. He studied at his
grandfather’s university, taking the degrees of B.S. and C.E. in 1873, and giving the
commencement oration at graduation. The next twenty years saw him in various
activities. For three years he followed his profession as civil engineer. In 1876 he taught
in the school his mother had established. In 1882 he was associated with Mrs William B
Rice and Miss Louisa Lee Schuyler in the work of the New York State Charities Aid

Association. For a short time he was with Scribner’s Magazine, writing general articles
and book reviews. He wrote two books, &quot;The Nature of Poetry&quot; and &quot;A Few Steps in
Philosophy&quot;. In June 1893, he was chosen superintendent of the Lenox Library in
succession to Dr George H Moore, who had died in May 1892. In the service of the
Lenox and The New York Public libraries he spent the rest of his life. The title of his
position changed from time to time, but the man himself changed little except to grow
more strongly in the respect and affection of those privileged to work with him. When
Dr Billings reorganized the staff of the Library in 1896, after he took active charge of
the newly consolidated institutions, he brought Mr Lockwood from the Lenox building
to the Astor and made him Business Superintendent. Another change of title took place
when the new Central Building was opened in 1911 and Mr Lockwood became Bursar.
Throughout his life he took a keen interest in art. Largely self-taught, he came to sketch
and draw well, and he found in pastel a satisfactory medium of expression. As a greatgrandson of Rev. William Lockwood (1753-1828), Brigade Chaplain to Nixon and
Patterson&#x27;s brigade of Massachusetts’s troops in 1780 and 1783, he was a member of the
Society of Cincinnati and of the Sons of the Revolution. He married June 5, 1889 Sarah
Wisner [dau of William Henry &amp; Eleanor Bowne (Horner) Wisner] born in July 1850
NYC and dfied October 1944; (Thanks to Ferris Cook for this info!) and born to them
