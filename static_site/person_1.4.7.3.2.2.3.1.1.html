THE PLAIN DEALER January 16, 2000 By Evelyn Theiss; Plain Dealer Reporter
From her Bratenahl Place apartment with its view of brown-gray treetops and an even grayer Lake Erie, Louise &quot;Ligi&quot;
Ireland recounts how, as a 19-year-old summering in the south of France, she had to fend off an amorous Harpo Marx.
&quot;Someone introduced us and he was very nice and asked me to dinner,&quot; she said. &quot;I thought we&#x27;d have a lovely talk about
the movie world. But as soon as dinner was over, he pounced on me. &quot;I ran, but he ran after me - he gave me some
exercise!&quot; She never did end up meeting his brothers. Ireland, 94 - &quot;I&#x27;ve never lied about my age, I&#x27;m proud of it&quot; - has many
such anecdotes about a life that took her from a childhood in Rome and Washington, D.C., to Paris and New York, where
she crossed paths with some of the most prominent people of the century. Her secretary, Suzanne Koporc, began hearing the
lively tales in 1993 after she started working for the woman everyone calls &quot;Ligi.” &quot;We started writing them down,&quot; Koporc
said. When Ireland&#x27;s three children would come to visit from their out-of-state homes, Koporc would share the stories. &quot;So
many times they&#x27;d say, &#x27;I hadn&#x27;t heard that!&#x27; she said. Soon, Koporc transferred Ireland&#x27;s longhand notes to a computer.
Ireland and Koporc continued to work together and the result is a self-published book called &quot;Ligi: A Life in the Twentieth
Century.” It is available at Apple tree Books in Cleveland Heights for $28. Names tell the story. &quot;Ligi&quot; is the acronym based
nickname of Louise Ireland Grimes Ireland, who was born into the Ireland family in 1904 in Bar Harbor, Maine. Louise
Ireland married Charles Grimes, a prominent lawyer who in the 1930s worked with special prosecutor Thomas Dewey, the
future Republican presidential nominee, to bust New York City&#x27;s rackets. Ten years after Grimes&#x27; death in 1957, his widow
renewed her acquaintance with her cousin R. Livingston &quot;Liv&quot; Ireland of Cleveland. The two enchanted each other and six
months later, because Ohio did not allow marriages between first cousins, they married in Washington, D.C. Liv died in
1981. By then, Ligi Ireland loved Cleveland and decided to stay. That is a bare-bones synopsis of her life; her book fleshes
out the details. Having outlived her peers, the polite yet earthy Ireland feels free to share her opinions about some of her
famous
acquaintances. Such as Benjamin Spock, the famed baby doctor turned author and peace activist, whom
Ireland met when he was a medical student in New York. Spock married Ireland&#x27;s school chum, Jane Cheney. &quot;On Sundays,
the medical students&#x27; only day off, he would invite us to his apartment and turn on the phonograph. He used to swing his
partners around so fast we were practically thrown out the windows.” Ireland had an inkling that Spock would become an
acclaimed physician. &quot;He extended his studies more than other medical students,&quot; she said. &quot;He was very interested in
psychology, in what happened to the emotions, as well as in medicine.&quot;Ireland&#x27;s children were two of Spock&#x27;s first pediatric
patients. Later, Ireland recalled, &quot;He got famous and divorced his wife and married a woman half his age.” Spock, who in
the 1960s taught at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, crossed paths with Ireland once in Cleveland. &quot;By
then he had become very stuck up,&quot; Ireland said. Louise Ireland&#x27;s childhood was unconventional, considering the privileged
family into which she was born. Her ancestors include William Floyd, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, and
James Duane, New York City&#x27;s first mayor. Louise&#x27;s mother, Arline, divorced her husband, Jack Ireland, while she was
pregnant. Since divorce was considered shameful in New York&#x27;s Victorian society, Arline took her infant daughter to Italy,
where they lived in Rome. They spent summers in Maine. They also traveled Europe. When Louise was about 10, Arline
introduced her daughter to Paris fashion. &quot;I remember the fashion showings in the salons of the famous couturiers Channel, Worth and Lanvin. I&#x27;d sit with the other ladies and watch the parade of beautiful clothes,&quot; Ireland said. Arline
bought outfits for herself and her daughter. &quot;Then I&#x27;d wear three or four dresses on top of each other when we went through
U.S. customs,&quot; Ireland said. Returning to America when World War I erupted, Arline sold her villa to Guglielmo Macroni,
inventor of the wireless. Some of the fine Italian antiques she took with her are in Ireland&#x27;s Bratenahl apartment today - giltedged mirrors, an ornately carved sideboard. A life-size portrait of Arline and her sister Jessica, painted by a Florentine

master in their villa&#x27;s music room, hangs in the entry. Mother and daughter moved to Washington, D.C., where one of
Ireland&#x27;s good friends was Felicia Patterson Gizycka, daughter of newspaper publisher Cissy Patterson and later, the wife of
Washington columnist Drew Pearson. Another good friend was Rosamond Pinchot, a &quot;great beauty&quot; who became a
Hollywood actress. Then there was the train ride from Paris to Nice that Ireland, then in her 20s, shared with companions
Tallulah Bankhead - &quot;a very naughty woman&quot; - and three of her girlfriends. Ireland writes that she cut the trip short after
another friend told her, &quot;Wake up! You are staying with the most notorious group of lesbians in this part of the world.&quot; Her
life was not all parties and travel. While in her 20s, Ireland worked as a volunteer for birth control advocate Margaret
Sanger. &quot;I was very impressed with her, both as a person and as a pioneer for birth control and women&#x27;s rights - causes I
came to believe in and have supported all of my life,&quot; Ireland said. In her 40s, Ireland - who had studied at the Sorbonne and
at Barnard College and developed a keen interest in early childhood education - co-authored two books on child psychology
and parenting. &quot;Before Dr. Spock wrote his book,&quot; she notes with a smile. If there was a common theme in Ligi Ireland&#x27;s
life, it was her taste for travel and adventure. &quot;You were in your 60s when you learned to scuba dive,&quot; Koori reminds her.
Today, Ireland confines her travels to visits with her children; she stays current on world events, though, and tracks them at
a map table in her living room. Wearing a sea-blue sweater with red and yellow fish embroidered on it, Ireland reminisces
about how she loved the sea, and sailing Liv&#x27;s boat the &quot;Pandora IV&quot; down to the Bahamas. Mention of the Bahamas
triggers her memory of performing what she calls one of her &quot;parlor tricks&quot; - standing on her head, no matter the setting. &quot;I
remember I did that on a dock there,&quot; she said, after Liv dared her to show up a brawny sailor who was flexing his muscles.
&quot;Not very refined, I know, but I never thought about what other people would think,&quot; Ireland said. &quot;My whole life, I just
always wanted to have fun.&quot;

New Yorker Magazine, 25 Mar 1939: &quot;Asst. D.A.&quot;
&quot;We have just conducted an investigation of Charles P. Grimes, Dewey&#x27;s assistant in charge of the Hines investigation. We
find that he generally prepares for anything important by staying up all night. He stayed up all night before his marriage, in
1933. Last year he stayed up all night before leading the raid in Philadelphia in which Dixie Davis, Hope Dare, and George
Weinberg were captured. Accompanied by a sergeant and two detectives, Grimes drove from New York late at night (he had
stayed up at a party the night before this) and was stopped on the outskirts of Philadelphia for going eighty M.P.H. He and
his men flashed their badges and were permitted to proceed after some scathing remarks. As they were circling the
apartment house where their quarry lay, another Philadelphia cop came along and stood right in front of the house under a
street lamp. He suspected something interesting was up and didn&#x27;t want to miss it. A Grimes detective finally drove him off
by whipping out a gun and threatening to shoot him. The raiders got into the building when Grimes rang the house
telephone of a doctor tenant and told his wife there&#x27;s been a bad accident. She clicked the electric lock on the front door and
the raiding party burst into the Weinberg-Davis suite. Dixie was speechless with fright. He thought someone had sent some
of the boys down to knock them off. &quot;The Asst. D.A. is tall, wide, handsome, and reticent, and is called Charlie by most
people. He comes of a long line of Virginians but was born, thirty-four years ago, in Tacoma, Washington, where his father
was Episcopal Archdeacon of the Diocese of Olympia. At nine he made up his mind to be a lawyer, being moved to this
decision by the fact that around that time a crooked lawyer stole a valuable water-power site from his father. Charlie wanted
to become a lawyer not to steal power sites but to keep them from being stolen. Most of his father&#x27;s money was lost in the
power site episode, and Grimes went through the Taft School and Yale on scholarships. He was impatient with the New
Haven curriculum and took the regular four year course and a half year of law in three years. The college dean, thinking this
was a reflection on Yale, tried to discourage him by stipulating that he maintain an honors&#x27; average. Grimes did this and on
the side won letters in wrestling and crew, read all of Proust, and tutored small, wealthy children in the summer. He
graduated with the class of 1927 and still feels a greater spiritual kinship with &#x27;28. &quot;After law school, Grimes worked for
Cravath, De Gersdorff, Etc., and later was in Washington as counsel for NRA and PWA. He joined Dewey&#x27;s in 1935. One of
his jobs was the extradition of Alexander Pompez, the Harlem numbers banker, from Mexico. A Mexican army officer
whom Grimes met at a party in Mexico City offered to have Pompez bumped off and delivered for 200 pesos, or $50.
Grimes said he wanted him alive. The Mexican officer couldn&#x27;t get this point of view, Grimes was further astonished in
Mexico by the politeness of a secret agent with whom he and the Chief of Police of Mexico City drove around a good deal.
The agent, a stout, elderly fellow, always insisted on sitting up front with the chauffeur, leaving Grimes in the more
comfortable seat with the Chief of Police. Grimes remonstrated at this excessive consideration on the part of an older man.

The agent explained that he knew of six criminals who had taken an oath to kill the Chief of Police, and he felt happier in
front. &quot;Grimes is a member of the Yale, Union League, and Seawanhaka-Corinthian Yacht Clubs, and of the Boilermakers,
Iron Ship Builders &amp; Helpers Union of America, Mt. Tahoma Lodge, No. 348. He joined the union while working summers
during the war. He likes to sing old sea chanteys he learned during this period, and accompany them by dancing a hornpipe.
He did this at the last annual New Year&#x27;s Eve ball at Tuxedo, raising himself considerably in the estimation of a good many
people who had hitherto looked on him simply as an assistant district attorney.&quot;
