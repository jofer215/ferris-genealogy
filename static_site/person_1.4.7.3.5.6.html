the first rector of St Paul’s Church, New Haven CT where he remained until he came to
St Bartholomew’s; he was greatly gifted as a pastor; sharing the jobs and tenderly
ministering to the sorrows of his people who loved and trusted him – see The Centennial

Bartholomew’s Church desire by this Minute to place on the records their regret on
hearing of the death of Mrs Cooke, and their sincere appreciation of her Christian life

and of the faithful aid she rendered in the work of the Parish as long as her health
permitted. Her memory will always be kept alive by those who sought her in times of
difficulty and sorrow, and who ever found in her a true, warm-hearted friend and
adviser.’ Born to them were 3 kids, 2 of which were:</div>
