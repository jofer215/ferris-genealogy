            <div class="person-text">(5.1.2.9.2.5.2.1.1) BERTHA BARKER born December 27, 1876 and died April 1963; married Edmund
Doane Foshay [son of John Wesley &amp; Matilda (Morley)] born September 9, 1877 Carmel NY and died
April 24, 1933 Kent NY; both buried Hillside cemetery, Peekskill NY. Obituary, Putnam Courier,
Friday, April 28, 1933: Edmund Doane Foshay, life long resident of Putnam County and for twelve
years clerk of the board of supervisors, died at his home at Kent Cliffs about four o&#x27;clock Monday
morning, April 24, 1933. He was in his 56th year. Mr. Foshay had been a sufferer of heart trouble, low
blood pressure and other complications for several years and had been confined in his home for more
than a year. Seven years ago he suffered an attack of pneumonia which time his condition was very
critical and although recovering after several months, his system was greatly weakened by his illness.
Notwithstanding his trying illness he continued his duties as clerk of the board of supervisors and bore
his illness without complaint. The deceased was one of a family of four children born to the late John
Wesley and Matilda Morley Foshay. Mr. Foshay born in the Putnam County Court House in Carmel,
Sept. 9, 1877, where his father resided as under-sheriff and he was named after Sheriff Edmond Doane,
under whom his father was serving at the time. The family moved to Farmers Mills from the Court
House and soon afterwards to Boyd&#x27;s Corners where Mr. Foshay&#x27;s father was in charge of New York
City&#x27;s watershed in Kent. A few years later they moved to Tompkins Corners and Mr. Foshay assisted
his father in the conduct of the general store for a few years when he engaged in farming on the
Lounsbury farm on East Hill. In 1900 Mr. Foshay was united in marriage with Miss Bertha Barker and
five years later they moved to Kent Cliffs, where Mr. Foshay became a clerk for the late Asbury C.
Townsend in his general store and other extensive business enterprises. He was associated with Mr.
Townsend for fourteen years during which time Mr. Foshay served as postmaster. A few years after
going to Kent Cliffs, Mr. Foshay built a new home where he had since resided and where his death
occurred. Mr. Foshay on his paternal side was a descendant of a well known family of Putnam County
who for many years have been active in the various walks of life here. Like his ancestors, Mr. Foshay

took an active part in local affairs; he was a member of the Kent Cliffs Baptist Church for several
years, a member of the Putnam Valley Grange and had served as an officer of the Halstead Cemetery
for several years. On Feb. 18, 1914, Mr. Foshay was raised to membership in the Croton Lodge of
Masons at Brewster and occupied various chairs until he became Master in 1921, during which year he
had a busy term raising several into the principles of Masonry. He was also a member of the Eastern
Star. Surviving Mr. Foshay are his widow and one daughter, Mrs. Theron Beacom, of Katonah, and two
sisters, Mrs. Daniel H. Cole, of Carmel and Mrs. William H. Tompkins, of Putnam Valley. Interment
was made in the family plot in Hillside Cemetery at Peekskill.
