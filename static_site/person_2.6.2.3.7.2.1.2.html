            <div class="person-text">(2.6.2.3.7.2.1.2) ANNA E. KNAPP married 1905, as his 2d wife, Dr. Wesley Wait, D.D.S. [son of
Thomas and Mary (Mould) Wait] born at the old Wait homestead in Montgomery, Orange, NY May 15,
1861. His early education was gained at one of the many excellent private boarding schools on the
Hudson near his home. After he left school he went to New York City and there took up the study of

medicine and dentistry, where after only eight months&#x27; study he was made first assistant to the college
professor. He finished the required four-year course in dentistry in eighteen months. In 1884 he left
New York City and opened an office in Goshen, New York, where he remained for eighteen months.
He then went to Chicago, Illinois, remaining, however, but a short time returning to Newburg, New
York, where he began the practice of dentistry which he has carried on with ever increasing success to
the present time. Dr. Wait has always been a student of physics, and has marked mechanical talent. He
is the inventor of various electrical appliances in successful use. His device for the interlocking of
large steel girders without the use of bolts or rivets was put to the test at Columbia University in 1911,
and showed one hundred per cent of practical advantage over the old method. He was the delegate of
New York State for three years to the International Association of Manufacturers and Inventors, now
known as the Manufacturers&#x27; Association. Dr. Wait has also contributed to the technical magazines a
number of scientific articles in several fields of natural science, and has lectured upon those topics
before audiences at Colombia, Lehigh and other universities. Dr. Wait is an attendant of the First
Presbyterian Church of Newburg. He was a Republican in political belief, but is now a member of the
National Progressive Party. Mrs. Wait was widely known for her charitable work. She was a most
devout Christian and an enthusiastic missionary worker, a member of the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian
Church, New York City and she was deeply interested in the remodeling of St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital at
Newburg, giving upwards of $50,000 to that purpose, erecting the south wing as a memorial to her
father, Samuel Trevor Knapp. She died in February 1912.</div>
