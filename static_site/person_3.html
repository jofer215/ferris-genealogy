            <div class="person-text">(3)JOSEPH (AFN: 8RLK-5W)(K4DT-SN)
born September 20, 1638 Greenwich (or June 20, 1635 at Watertown MA.) (or September 20, 1635) (if
the birth date of 1635 is correct, then Joseph would the second born of Jeffrey&#x27;s children) and died
between June 9 and July 24, 1699, (Greenwich) (Horseneck); probably buried at Stamford. He may
have been a farmer and was a Puritan (Congregationalist); was one of the original patentees named in
the patent granted to the Town of Greenwich by the General Assembly May 1665. Joseph was an

of the 52 landowners. The frequent land transactions in which he was involved are indicative of
increasing prosperity, which is further verified by the tax rate of 1697, his assessment at that time being

8S9K-8K) {daughter of Nicholas and Eleanor (maiden name unk) Knapp} born January 6, 1640/1
Watertown, Mass., and died c1702 Stamford (Greenwich?) CT [Ruth’s date of death is in question according to a reference she sold her property rights to her son, Joshua, in 1711.][There are those who
also contend that she remarried after Joseph&#x27;s death.]; 1681-82 Joseph was a representative to the
General Court. There is conflicting information on where they resided after they married; in Stamford
and/or Greenwich; it is said that they moved to Stamford 1699. All of their children were either born in
Greenwich or Stamford. [Jim - Their children are not in sequence by birth; there is conflicting
information as to birth dates.] Born to them were:</div>
