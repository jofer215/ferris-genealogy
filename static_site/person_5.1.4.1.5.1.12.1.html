Lockwood, Charles Davenport. Story Of Stamford - Historical Address -On the occasion of the celebration of
the 275th anniversary of the founding of the Town of Stamford, Connecticut - Delivered in the Stamford Theatre
on June Eleventh, 1916. (Stamford, Connecticut); 1916. 29 pp., paper covers, 23 cm.

&quot;This meeting today is particularly a Stamford congregation, and we are here primarily to congratulate ourselves
over the proud history of our town, to pay a tribute to those who have labored in times past for the development
of Stamford, and perhaps to consider whether we are in a proper way upholding and continuing the work so
nobly instituted and carried on by those who are with us no longer, and whose monument is the town in which
we dwell...Within the next twenty-five years many questions and reforms should receive the attention of our
citizens. All admit that in our town and city governments with a duplicate set of officials we have a cumbersome,
ineffective and expensive system of local government...Who will change the system? If the partners in this
municipal enterprise will live up to their obligations, improvements in all these directions will come not in a day
or a year, for it takes a generation for an innovation to become a custom, but this does not excuse us from
making a beginning.&quot; Charles Davenport Lockwood, pp. 3, 27-28.

He married October 13, 1906 Gertrude Bell [dau of Harry &amp; Olive E. (Barber) Bell] (1880-), and born
