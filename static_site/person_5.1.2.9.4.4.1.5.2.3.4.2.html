(5.1.2.9.4.4.1.5.2.4) HERMAN TOMPKINS born September 20, 1912 and died August 3, 1931
Brewster NY; buried Shrub Oak Methodist Cemetery, Shrub Oak NY. Obituary, Brewster Times,
Brewster, NY, Aug. 1931: Herman Tompkins, eighteen years old, was killed Monday morning in an
explosion of gasoline in a pump house on the farm of Benjamin O. Nichols, on Brewster Hill, about
three and a half miles north of Brewster. The young man who was employed on the farm, went to the
pump house to look after the gasoline engine that raises water from a well beneath it. The house, which
is a mere shed housing the engine and pump, stands beneath a tall windmill and the engine is in a pit
below the surface of the ground. Just what occurred is a matter of speculation but it is believed that
Tompkins attemped to fill the tank of the engine with gasoline and that a spark was struck in some
manner or else the apparatus was hot and ignited the gasoline. A can that had contained gasoline and a
funnel were found near the body. Men at work in the neighboring field heard the sound of a heavy
explosion from the pump house and found that the building was on fire. They ran to the place but the
flames were burning so fiercely that they were unable to enter the building. A telephone message was
sent to the Brewster Fire Department and the motor apparatus made a speedy run to the Nichols farm.
The building was almost destroyed when the firemen arrived. Knowing that young Tompkins had been
in the building, the ruins were cooled as quickly as possible. When the firemen were able to enter the
place they found the youth&#x27;s body in the pit. The body was not badly burned and Dr. Cleaver, of
Brewster, who examined it, said death probably had been due to suffocation. The young man was the
son of Mr. and Mrs. Hart Tompkins of Brewster.</div>
