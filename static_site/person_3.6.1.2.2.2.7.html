against Port Hudson, La., and Major 28 October 1864 for gallantry and meritorious service in the battle
of Hatcher&#x27;s Run, VA. He was on duty in Washington drilling volunteers from July 3 to 9, 1861; then

and served therewith at Fort Hamilton NY to July 31, 1862 and at Fort Columbus NY to October, 1862,
when he received a leave of absence to organize a Volunteer Regiment and was mustered-in at Camp
Terry, New Haven, Conn., November 15, 1862 as a Colonel, at age 22, with the 28th Connecticut
Infantry Regiment and served with this regiment in Florida. On June 3, 1863, before Port Hudson, he
was given command of the 1st Brigade, of the 3d Division, of the 19th Army Corps and held this
position until July 14, 1863. In July 1863, at New Orleans, he received a medical certificate stating he
was medically unfit to continue his duties for a period of thirty days because, &quot;he has had the Bilious
Remittent fever followed by a diarrhea which has assumed a chronic form, from which he is now
suffering&quot;. This Certificate allowed him a leave of absence, presumably to recover from his illness. He
was mustered out of that Regiment on August 28, 1863. He rejoined the 8th US Infantry September 30,
1863 and served therewith at Fort Columbus NY to November 27, 1863; escorting prisoners to Hilton

Fannie H. Smith (born July 28, 1842 at Bristol CT), December 26, 1861 at the residence of her mother
in Haverstraw, Rockland County NY. There were married by Rev. Dr. Crane, a minister of the
Methodist Episcopal Church of Haverstraw. They did not have any children. Fannie applied for and
received a pension at the rate of $20.00 a month (#200,242). After Samuel&#x27;s death, she lived in
Stamford, CT and in Chicago, at 117 South Pauline St and in 1912 her address was Rue Scribe 11,
Paris, France. In 1920, she resided at Fairfield IL. Her pension was raised to $50.00 a month. Fannie
died February 10, 1927, while living at 5610 Dorchester Ave., Chicago IL. There was a Samuel P.
Ferris Post of the Grand Army of the Republic (G.A.R.) of New Canaan CT. Personnel from this Post,
veterans of the Civil War, participated in a parade for the unveiling of a monument erected to the
memory of the Soldiers and Sailors of the Civil War, October 22, 1890. Apparently no offspring.
WRITTEN BY LIEUTENANT-COLONEL W. T. BATCHELLER, LATE OF THE
TWENTY-EIGHTH CONNECTICUT VOLUNTEERS.
THE Twenty-eighth was the last Connecticut regiment organized under the call for nine months
volunteers. It was recruited in the Fourth Congressional District, and was
composed of only eight companies: five companies from Fairfield County and three companies from
Litchfield County. Samuel P. Ferris of Stamford, a graduate of West Point, was commissioned
Colonel, holding the office during the entire service of the regiment, and was a great favorite with the
men. The Twenty-eighth rendezvoused about September 15, 1862, at New Haven, and was in tents and
barracks at Camp Terry about two months. November 15th the regiment was mustered into the service
of the United States, and three days later took leave of New Haven and Connecticut by boat. On the
next day, November 19th, the regiment went into camp at Centerville, on Long Island, for ten days
only, as it broke camp November 29th, and six companies went on board steamer &quot;Che Kiang,&quot; with a
portion of the Twenty-third Connecticut, under command of Colonel Holmes. The two companies not
on the &quot;Che Kiang&quot; were sent by steamer, and joined the regiment after many disagreeable experiences.
The &quot;Che Kiang&quot; sailed from New York on the 3d of December, 1862, and had a very rough passage,
encountering a terrible storm off Hatteras, but reached Ship Island safely on the 12th. The regiment
remained only long enough to recover from sea-sickness, and then re-embarked and sailed from Ship
Island December 17th. On December 19th it landed at Camp Parapet at Carrollton, La., but remained
there only for a short time, leaving for Pensacola, Fla., on the 20th, and arriving there on the 22d. At
Pensacola the Twenty-eighth made a long and pleasant stay. The various companies were quartered in
houses abandoned by the owners when the Confederates evacuated the place. Drill and guard duties
occupied much of the time, but the work was just about enough for health, and the salubrious winter
climate added to make the sojourn of the regiment here memorable, and this the most pleasant of any of
its stopping-places. Expeditions into the interior and along the coast were occasionally made, serving to

break the monotony of camp and guard duty, and once in a while the cry of &quot;Steamer coming!&quot; would
cause the boys to hurry to the housetops in order to catch a glimpse of the welcome visitor; but too
often the cry was only raised by some practical joker. When the steamer came with the mail there was a
busy time, reading the &quot;news from home,&quot; and, until the steamer&#x27;s departure, writing to friends and
loved ones. Pensacola was evacuated March 20th, and the Twenty-eighth moved to Barrancas and into
tents. Camp duties were about the same here as at Pensacola, an occasional expedition serving to give
variety to camp life. May 10th the regiment left Barrancas by steamer, and on the 12th landed at
Brashear City, La., and left there without regret on May 23d, arriving at Springfield Landing May 25th,
and at Port Hudson on May 26th. While at this place, and until the surrender was made by the
Confederates, the Twenty-eighth was continually under fire, and assisted in all the various siege
operations and in the trenches. In the assault on June 14th it furnished one hundred of the two hundred
and fifty men for the storming party or &quot;forlorn hope.&quot; Its loss in killed and wounded was severe in this
engagement. At the surrender the Twenty-eighth moved inside the fortifications and remained at this
place until its departure for home on August 7th. Several died on the way home, having become
enfeebled by the climate and by disease previous to embarking for Connecticut. The route home was
via Mississippi River to Cairo, and thence by rail. On August 28th the survivors were mustered out at
New Haven.
