&quot;Mrs. Florence Wood Spears of this city died Sunday morning, January 10 at the age of 68, in a
Pekin hospital where she had been a patient the last week. She first became ill several weeks ago while
visiting at the home of her daughter, Mrs. E. A. Gidcombe in Peoria and was unable to attend the
funeral of her husband, Dr. George W. Spears who dies December 19. She born in Petersburg on April
13, 1874 the daughter of the late Horace A. and Lizzie Miles Wood. She was a sister of Judge
Harlington Wood, Sangamon county judge and of Miss Beulah Wood. Mrs. Spears was active in the
local Christian church and was superintendent of the Sunday school more than fifteen years.
Mrs. Spears is survived by her daughter, Mrs. E. A. Gidcombe and two grandchildren; one sister,
Miss Beulah Wood of Petersburg, who is employed in the office of Arthur Leuder, state auditor of
public accounts in Springfield, and her brother, Judge Wood.
Funeral services were held Tuesday at 3 p.m. at the Christian church in this city conducted by
Rev. Mack A. Warren. Burial was in Oakland cemetery, the pallbearers being Miles Grey, Dale
Peterson, James Miles Jr., Ralph Reding, G. Sam Watkins and Dr. Irving Newcomer.&quot;
&quot;(1905) Dr. G. W. Spears, engaged in the practice of dentistry in Petersburg, born in Tallula,
Menard county, May 1, 1869, a son of G. C. and Elizabeth Spears, the former born in Kentucky on the
18th of April, 1822, while the latter&#x27;s birth occurred in Menard county. In their family were nine
children, of whom G. W. Spears is the seventh in order of birth.
Reared under the parental roof, Dr. Spears devoted the greater part of his boyhood to the
acquirement of a good education in the public school of his native town, and when he had mastered the
more specifically literary branches of knowledge he entered upon the mastery of the principles of

dentistry, matriculating in the Chicago Dental College, where he completed the regular course and was
graduated on the 1st of May, 1902. Immediately afterward he came to Petersburg. He did not have
long to wait for patients and his business has grown continually, so that he now has a large and
gratifying practice. He is familiar with the latest methods known to the science, has his office equipped
with the latest improved dental appliances, and his skill in performing the mechanical work connected
with the profession has secured him a very desirable patronage, which indicates that he has found favor
with the public.
On the 1st of January 1902, Dr. Spears was united in marriage to Miss Florence Wood, of
Petersburg, a daughter of H. A. Wood, one of the old settlers and prominent residents of Menard
County. The Doctor and his wife are members of the Christian church, have many friends and occupy
an enviable position in social circles here. Fraternally he is connected with the Knights of Pythias
lodge, and in the line of his profession he is a member of the Alumni Association of the Chicago Dental
College and also belongs to the Illinois State Dental Society. He is a Republican in politics, but cares
nothing for public office.&quot;
&quot;Dr. C. St. Clair Drake, managing officer at the Jacksonville State Hospital, has announced the
appointment of Dr. George W. Spears of Petersburg as dentist at the Jacksonville State Hospital. Dr.
Spears has been practicing dentistry in Petersburg and is well qualified for the local position. He is
married and he and his wife and 15-year-old daughter will make their home here after the end of the
school year. Dr. Spears succeeds Dr. Claude Durfree who recently resigned to engage in private
practice in Clinton, Ill.&quot;
