LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT OF JOSEPH FERRIS

I, Joseph Ferris, of the town of Savannah, in the County of Wayne, and State of New
York, of the age of 67 years and upwards, being of sound mind and memory do make,
publish and declare this my Last Will and Testament in manner following, that is to say:
First, I direct my executors, herein after named, to sell and convert into money all the
real and personal property of which I may die seized or possessed and I direct and
authorized them to sell the same upon such terms of credit as they may deem for best
advantage to my estate and I authorize and empower my said the executors to execute all
necessary deeds of conveyance of my said real estate to the purchaser or purchasers
thereof and to take such bonds and mortgages for the purchase money as they may think
best, using their own discretion as to time to be given for purchase price, to the end that
the list price may be obtained and out of the avails of such sales of personal property and
real estate I direct my said executors to first pay all my just debts, funeral expenses and
expense of selling my estate.
Second, I give and bequeath to such of the children of my deceased son Washington
Ferris as shall be living at the time of my decease the sum of two thousand dollars to be
divided equally between them by my said executors, share and share alike, and I direct
my said executors to pay such sum to them from the avails of the property herein
directed to be sold.
Third, I give and bequeath to my daughter Julia Sweet, wife of Vaughn Sweet, the sum
of two thousand dollars and I direct my executors, herein after named, to pay the said
sum to her from the avails of the property herein before directed to be sold and should
my daughter Julia Sweet not survive me, then the said sum shall be paid to her heirs,
share and share alike.
Fourth, I given bequeath to my son O&#x27;Connell Ferris, now residing in the state of
Michigan, the sum of two thousand dollars, and I direct my executors, herein after
named, to pay the sum to him from the avails of the property herein directed to be sold
and should my said son not survive me, then the said sum shall be paid to his heirs, share
and share alike.
Fifth, I give and bequeath to my daughter Dolly Jane Davis, wife of John Davis, the sum
of two thousand dollars, and I direct my executors, herein after named, to pay the same
to her from the avails of the sale of my said real and personal property, and should my
said daughter not survive me, then the said sum shall be paid to her heirs, share and
share alike.

Sixth, I give and bequeath to my son Nelson Ferris, the sum of two thousand dollars and
I direct my executors, herein after named, to pay the same to him from the avails of my
real and personal property, herein directed to be sold and should my said son not survive
me, I direct said sum to be paid to his heirs, share and share alike.
Seventh, should any sum be left after paying the debts, legacies and sums herein before
directed to be paid, I give and bequeath the same as follows: one sixth part thereof to
such of the children of my said deceased son Washington Ferris, as shall be living at the
time of my death, divided between them share and share alike; and the remaining five
sixths to my children Julia Sweet, Sarah Hall, O&#x27;Connell Ferris, Dolly Jane Davis and
Nelson Ferris to be divided between them, share and share alike and should any of my
said children not survive me, his or her share under this clause shall be paid to his or her
heirs, share and share alike, and I direct my executors to make such payment.
Eighth, should any of my children desire to purchase the homestead where I now reside,
it is my will that they have the preference over others desiring to purchase at the same
terms. I have omitted to give my daughter, Sarah F. Hall as much as my other children
because I had given more than the sum here in named for each of them to her and her
husband in the sale, to them, of a farm this year.
Lastly, I nominate and appoint my son O&#x27;Connell Ferris and my sons-in-law Vaughn
Sweet and Aaron F. Hall executors of this my Last Will and Testament and I revoke all
former wills by me ever made.
In Testimony Whereof I have to this my Last Will and Testament written upon two
sheets of paper subscribed my name and affixed my seal this Second day of November,
