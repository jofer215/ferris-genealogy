            <div class="person-text">(3.1.9.1.9.9.14.2) LILLIAN ARLEY HERRELL (Photos) born December 8, 1885 Howard Co MD - 9

30 years old, Chester William Morris born April 21, 1917 and is still living in 2000. He was originally
from Pennsylvania and came to DC to be the superintendent of the Washington Branch of the Autocar
and Truck Company. After they married Enola sold the restaurant and began to raise a family. When
Will married Lillian, he also got a live-in mother-in-law - Enola lived with them until she died. Born to
