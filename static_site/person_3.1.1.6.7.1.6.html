            <div class="person-text">(3.1.1.6.7.1.6) ELEANOR BLASDEL (Eleanor Chase Blasdel) born June 20, 1838 Stringtown, Ripley,
IN and died March 27, 1920 Farmer City, DeWitt, IL; married December 20, 1858 Jacob Blasdel Chase
[son of Leonard &amp; Sarah B. (Blasdel) Chase] born April 5, 1836 Lawrenceburg IN and died September
30, 1898 Kirksville, Adair, MO; both buried Blue Ridge Cemetery (there are 3 in MO?); Obit, April 2,
1920: “Last Saturday morning at 8 o’clock the golden cord which bound “Grandma” Eleanor Chase to
this life was loosed and her soul took flight to that brighter and better world toward which her kindly
eyes had so long been turned. She was stricken with a general physical breakdown at the time her loved
granddaughter, Mrs W. S. Mitchell, was taken to the hospital after she had freely spent her strength in
caring for the patient at home, and less than a week after the granddaughter succumbed to her operation
the vital spark of the grandmother was quenched. She was conscious only at short intervals during the
sickness, but in these brief moments she was able to communicate with her son, Enoch, who had come
home from Oklahoma, her brother, B. F. Blasdel, who was here from Catlin, her daughters, Mrs. Stella
Kirk of Lyons IN and Mrs Ella J Melton of Bellflower, and the members of the household. The funeral
was conducted in the Christian church on Tuesday afternoon by the pastor, rev J Ralph Roberts, and
interment was made in the Blue Ridge cemetery by the side of the husband, her dearly loved
granddaughter, Mrs. Mitchell, and other relatives who had gone before. Eleanor Blasdel was born near
Milan IN June 20, 1838 and died March 27, 1920, age 81 years, 9 months 7days. She was married to
Jacob B Chase on December 20, 1858, who preceded her in death September 30, 1898. To them were
born ten children, of whom three daughters and one son survive her – Mrs Kirk of Lyons IN, Mrs
Melton of Bellflower, Mrs Edna Myers of Farmer City and Enoch Chase of Tonkawa, OK. Two
brothers, B F Blasdel of Catlin and Thomas N Blasdel of Milan IN, also survive. Mrs. Chase was not
only the mother of ten children, but the grandmother of 32 grandchildren, of whom 27 survive her, and
great-grandmother of 26. She was a tower of strength and Christian power in the rearing and guiding of
her descendants and the only mother Olive Mitchell, who was buried Wednesday of last week, ever
knew. Unit the beginning of her last illness she was able to get about among her friends and take a part

in the management of the household. She was granted by the Great Maker her earnest desire that she be
not permitted to live an invalid, though she knew none could be in better hands and receive better care
than her daughter, Mrs. Myers, and her cousin Dr. J. A. Nowlin, could give. She was a member of the
Farmer City Church of Christ for 20 years.”; and born to them were:</div>
