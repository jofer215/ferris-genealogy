            <div class="person-text">(3.1.2.1.4.6.1.1) ELIZABETH MARIAH LONDON (2d born) “Eliza Maria” born March 9, 1834
Luzerne Co PA and died June 8, 1914 DuBois, Clearfield Co PA; married c1860 in Jefferson County
PA, Andrew Jackson Johnston [son of William B &amp; Margaret (Keener) Johnston] born April 23, 1832
DuBois, Sandy Township, Clearfield Co PA and died June 16, 1905, probably in DuBois PA. Obit:
“Mrs. Eliza M Johnston passed away while visiting at the home of her son. Eliza Johnston died
Monday at 2:00 at the home of her son, Charles, of DuBois, cause of death was given as gallstones. She
had been making her home for the past five years with her daughter, Mrs. Susan Weaver near Salem
and went to DuBois on Thursday last to visit with her son. While she was there she was taken sick and
her condition grew worse until death came Monday morning. The decease was 80y of age last March.
She is survived by the following children: J. K. of Reynoldsville; Mrs. Susan Weaver of Salem; David,
Trenton NJ; G. M., McKees Rocks; William, Youngstown OH; John of Buffalo; Mrs. J. O. Lenkerd of
C&amp;M Junction; Joseph of Driftwood; Charles of DuBois. One child is dead. The husband of the
deceased, A. J. Johnston, died 10 years ago. The deceased had lived at that section since 1891 and was
a woman quite widely known having many friends who will regret to hear of her death. The funeral
services were held Thursday afternoon at the home of her son, Charles at DuBois. The services were
conducted by Rev Henry Johnston of the Baptist Church. Interment was made at the Rumbarger
Cemetery, DuBois, Clearfield, PA (Photo). Following close to the death of Mrs. Johnston came word of
the death of one of her daughters, Mrs. Winslow, which occurred at the Loch Haven Hospital Tuesday.
Mrs. Winslow had gone there four weeks ago to undergo an operation and had expected to return home
this week. Details of her death have not been received but it is thought that the shock of hearing that
her mother had died was in part responsible for the suddenness of her end. Her body was taken to the
home at Benezette and burial will probably be made today.” Born to them were:</div>
