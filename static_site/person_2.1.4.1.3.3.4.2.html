            <div class="person-text">(2.1.4.1.3.3.4.2) FRED ELIJAH FERRIS (Photos) born February 2, 1879 Stark Co IL and died there
February 8, 1960. About 1900, Fred purchased a farm on section 29, Osceola Township, consisting of a
tract of land of one hundred and sixty-five acres devoted to general farming. The farm was the visible
evidence of his life of well directed energy and thrift for he was a self made man, who started in
business life with nothing. Diligence and determination, however, have overcome the obstacles and
difficulties in his path, and he worked his way steadily upward. Fred’s father, George, died when Fred
was a lad of but fourteen years. Fred was educated in the common schools and was reared upon the old
home farm. Early undertaking the task of plowing and cultivating the land and producing the crops,
there soon came to him knowledge of the value of industry and perseverance, and he used these
qualities to enable him to gain a financial start. Fred married March 15, 1906 in Stark Co IL, Agnes E.
Scott [dau of Robert &amp; Mary Margaret (Trumbull) Scott] born March 5, 1883 Osceola Township, Stark
Co IL and died March 12, 1974 Kewanee, Stark, IL. Mrs. Ferris belonged to the Presbyterian Church.
Mr. Ferris gave his political indorsement to the Democratic Party and its principles, and, while he did

not seek nor desire political office, he served for seven years as school director, doing all in his power
to further the interests of public education in his neighborhood. Both buried Lot C-2, Osceola Grove
Cemetery, Stark Co IL. Born to Fred and Agnes were:</div>
