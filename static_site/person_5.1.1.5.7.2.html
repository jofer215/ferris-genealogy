            <div class="person-text">(5.1.1.5.7.2) CYRUS MEAD FERRIS born March 31, 1812 Lewisboro (S. Salem) NY and died
December 31, 1890; the first postmaster of the Lewisboro Post Office in 1842; according to a source,
Cyrus had in his possession a watch, which belonged to his grandfather, Silvanus, who carried it
through the Indian Wars and the campaign of Ticonderoga and Crown Point. When the Tories made a
raid on Sylvanus, he saved his watch by burying it in the ashes behind the back log. The watch, which
was purchased in 1754 was still in a good state of preservation when Cyrus had it. At a Lewisboro town
meeting in April 1855, Cyrus was appointed as a committee member to purchase land at Cross River,

South Salem, and at Lewisboro for free cemetery purposes. (See separate paper on Silvanus&#x27;s will for a
letter from Cyrus about his grandfather.) Cyrus owned a dog in 1848 and was taxed $.50 on the dog.
Cyrus married three times: 1st May 13, 1835 Julia Wood born c1810 and died February 8, 1854; 2d
March 23, 1858 Mary Frank Stebbins born c1838 and died February 24, 1871; and 3d Mary Bennett
Church born c1834 and died September 6, 1875. [Jim - he outlived all three wives!] Born to Cyrus and
Julia were:</div>
