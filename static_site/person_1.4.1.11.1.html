            <div class="person-text">(1.4.1.11.1) THOMAS THOMAS FERRIS; heir of Thomas estate, Harrison,
Westchester Co; he married twice. (See correspondence on General Thomas Thomas.)
Note for below regards Oscar Coles Ferris: Bretton Woods was built in 1894 by Oscar
Coles Ferris and his wife, Louise, granddaughter of Jacob Ford. Their efforts helped to
create the first bank in Morris Count as well as many other businesses. The Ferris house
was renamed in honor of the United Nations Monetary Financial Conference in 1944,
known as the Bretton Woods Conference, where gold became the world’s monetary
standard (See Net for Bretton Woods). The History of the Canfield/Phillips Family says
that Oscar Coles Ferris was married to Louisa Canfield, dau of Joseph Lovell &amp; Eliza H
(Ford) Canfield – Eliza was dau of Henry Ford. I am presuming the below Oscar Coles
Ferris is the same guy, but the names and dates don’t match up. It is possible that Oscar
remarried after Ada’s death; the Oscar and Louisa (Canfield) were married prior to 1897

because that is when Louisa’s sister Emily and her husband married – they met at Oscar
and Louisa’s place, in Morris Plains.</div>
