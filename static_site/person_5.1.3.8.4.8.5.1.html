            <div class="person-text">(5.1.3.8.4.8.5.1) THEODORE PARKER FERRIS (Rev.) (D.D.) (photo) born December 23, 1908
Portchester NY and died November 26, 1972 in the Rectory of Trinity Church, Boston MA; attended
high school in Port Chester; Harvard, A. B., 1929; General Theological Seminary, B. D, 1933; began
his ministry as assistant pastor at Grace Church, New York, 1933. Fellow, tutor, General Theological
Seminary, 1933-37; Rector Emmanuel Church, Baltimore, 1937-42 – “here week by week, a one-page
precise of the previous Sunday’s sermon was printed in the Pelican, as the service leaflet was called.

Almost immediately these precise began to have a wide circulation, far beyond the parish he was
serving. In 1942, be became the Rector of Trinity Church, Boston. Now the sermons were printed in
full. Within a few years the mailing list included every state in the country and many foreign lands. He
was greatly sought after as a preacher by other churches, colleges, and preparatory schools. For many
years he was an instructor of homiletics at the Episcopal Theological School. This enormous
accumulation formed the basis for his many books and the Exposition of The Acts of Apostles in the
Interpreter’s Bible. Dr. Ferris was a literary artist in the most basic meaning of words. His experience
of the presence of God in everyday life, his sensitivity to the joys and woes of human life, his
awareness of the majesty of nature, his appreciation of music, sculpture, and painting, all these lived in
his mind and soul. As he perceived great and invisible truths in all these dimensions, being an artist, he
was empowered to give them outward and visible expression in words, both spoken and written. This
was done in the most simple and straightforward vocabulary, with no use of high-flown phrases or
unusual words. During his rectorship Trinity Church continued, deepened, and broadened its
involvement in the life of the larger church and the community. He always found skilled people to
provide a wide variety of service in the city as well as in the Diocese and worldwide church. His great
devotion was to Trinity Church and its people; yet how wide was his span of interest and activity.
Conductor of a weekly radio program for many years; delegate to the World Council of Churches;
many times a deputy to the General Convention; a member of the various diocesan committees and
organizations; a prime mover in the construction of the new Sherrill House, a residence and nursing
home for older people; both an accomplished pianist and a Trustee of the Boston Symphony; all this
reveals the breadth of his ministry.” The honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity was conferred upon him
by Rollins College, Middlebury College, and Boston University; instructor homiletics Episcopal
Theological Seminary, Cambridge starting in 1943. Dr. Ferris was a delegate to the General
Convention in 1946, 1949, 1952, and 1955. Author: This Created World, 1944; Go Tell the People,
1951; This is the Day, 1951; The Story of Jesus, 1953; Exposition of the Acts of the Apostles in
the Interpreter&#x27;s Bible, 1954; The Image of God, 1965. He was one of the best-known preachers and
