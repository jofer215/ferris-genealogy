            <div class="person-text">(5.1.3.1.7.2.8.1) WILLIAM FERRIS AULL (Photo) born April 9, 1848 Charlestown, Portage, OH; PA
State Senator, 1883-86; married April 29, 1868 Anna Martin [dau of Caleb R &amp; Elizabeth J
(McFarland) Martin] born May 7, 1850 East Bradford, Chester, PA. From the History of
Pittsburg, 1898: The gentleman whose name heads this sketch is distinctively American, and so were his ancestors for
generations. He comes of Revoluntionary stock, for his paternal and maternal ancestors aided the colonists in their struggle
for freedom. His great grandfather, John Aull, was of Scotch-Irish ancestry, and came to America when this country was still
considered a possession of Great Britian, taking up his residence in Philadelphia. During the Revolutionary War, he served
in Captain Ashmead’s Company, Second Pennsylvania Continental Line, under Colonel Walter Stewart. His son, William
Aull, who was born in 1786, was one of the pioneers in Western Pennsylvania in the early part of the eighteenth century,
was married in Westmoreland County in 1813 to Elizabeth Hunter, and spent the greater part of his married life in Western
Pennslvania and Northern Virginia. He kept a hostelry for many years at Frankfort, Virginia, was an extensive contractor on
the construction of the old National pike, and in his day was one of the most prominent officials of the Masonic fraternity in
the Old Dominion. His son, James Aull, father of the subject of this sketch, was born in Westmoreland County,
Pennsylvania February 27, 1817, is still living in the East End, Pittsburg, and is a prominent member of and one of the
board of trustees in the Lincoln Avenue Methodist Episcopal Church. For fifty years he was in the livestock business, and is
known and respected by that fraternity in every livestock market from Chicago to New York as “honest Jimmy Aull”.

During his entire life he has never used tobacco in any form, liquor for any purpose,, or profanity under any pretext, and has
the well-merited reputation of never committing or countenancing a dishonest act. This record sand a long life of consistent
Christian devotion he will leave to his children as a heritage more valuable than fame or wealth. He was married to Miss
Phoebe Ferris, a school-teacher of Portage County, Ohio May 27, 1846. She was a woman of brilliant intellectual
attainment, and of strong Christian character. Her birth occurred at Eaton, Madison County, New York April 10, 1821, and
her death occurred in Pittsburg April 26, 1889. Her father, John Ferris, came from a prominent New York ancestry, and her
material grandfather, Colonel Black, was an officer in the Revolutionary War. From this ancestry the subject of this sketch
inherits his military inclination. The subject of this sketch was born in Charleston, Portage County, Ohio April 9, 1848, and
was educated in the common schools of Allegheny City and Philadelphia. In the latter city he resided during the early part
of the War of the Rebellion, where he constantly tried to enlist in the Union service, but was repeatedly rejected on account
of his youth. In 1863 he joined an emergency regiment from Philadelphia, and with it spent several weeks around
Harrisburg, called there to assist in protecting the capital when Lee penetrated Pennslyvania and fought the battle of
Gettysburg. During the following winter he ran away from school and enlisted in the 8th Pennsylvania Cavalry for three
years, but his father, with the assistance of Hon. William D. Kelly, member of Congress from Philadelphia, procured his
discharge, “direction of the President of the United States” under special order No. 132 from the War Department, dated
March 30, 1864. His parents then sent him to relatives in Ohio to get him away from the recruiting offices of Philadelphia,
but they had not fully calculated the spirit of patriotism nor the depth of loyalty that inspired the boy; May 2, 1864, he again
enlisted in the 171st Regiment Ohio Volunteer Infantry, with which regiment he served until it was mustered out of service.
He was captured after a severe engagement at Keller’s Bridge near Cynthiana, Kentucky, June 11th, 1864, and was
subsequently paroled. After the war he returned to Pittsburg, where he first graduated from the Iron City Commercial
College, after which he studied civil engineering under a private instructor. In 1867 he became assistant city engineer of
Pittsburg, and the following year entered the employ of the Denny estate, and has been associated continuously with the
management of that estate ever since. He is now and has been for the past seven years its attorney, in fact, and general agent.
Under his able management this vast estate has made rapid progress in improvements and prosperity, and under his
immediate supervision several hundred buildings have been erected in Pittsburg and Allegheny. In 1870 Mr Aull enlisted in
the National Guard of Pennsylvania and served continuously for 14 years, during which time he held every commission in
line of promotion from second lieutenant to lieutenant colonel. In the riots of 1877 he commanded the 18th Regiment,
N.G.P., during its long service in the anthracity coal regions, and he also served nearly three years on Major General John F.
Hartranft’s official staff when that officer was commander of the National Guard of Pennslyvania. In 1872 he was elected a
member of the Pittsburg City Council, and served continuously for seven years. In 1883 he was elected from the 44 th district
and served 4 years in the Pennslyvania State Senate. The Pittsburg Dispatch in its issue of March 19, 1885, speaking of the
senators from Allgheny County, says: “Senator Aull is the orator of the Allegheny County delegation, he is a hustler – one of
the few at Harrisburg this year. He does more work for the amount of health at his command than any man in the Senate.”
He is a member of the Engineers’ Society of Western Pennsylvania, of the Pittsburg Chamber of Commerce and of the
Grand Army of the Republic. He is also a 32d degree Mason and a Knight Templar in the same order. In 1868 he married
Anna Martin, daughter of C. R. and Eliza J. Martin, of Pittsburg. Her father is a grandson of Lieutenant Benjamin Miller,
who served in the 2d Pennslyvania Battalion in the Revolution, and her mother, Eliza J. McFarland, was a direct descendant
of Lord De-La-Ware, first Governor of Virginia, in 1610; of Henry Cornish, Lord Mayor of London in 1680, of John
McFarland, who served in the 4th Regiment Light Dragoons United States Cavalry during the War of the Revolution. Sterns’
published genealogy of the McFarland ancestry traces back in an unbroken chain Mrs. Aull’s maternal ancestors for 600
years. Mr. Aull is recognized as one of the successful business men of Pittsburg, resides in the East End, belongs to the
Methodist Episcopal Church, and has an interested family of two sons and two daughters.
