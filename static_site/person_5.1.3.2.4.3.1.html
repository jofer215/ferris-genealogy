            <div class="person-text">(5.1.3.2.4.3.1) CHARLES E. FERRIS born May 22, 1855 New Castle, Henry, IN; enjoyed superior
educational advantages in youth, and under his father&#x27;s instruction, acquired a comprehensive store of
useful knowledge; 1873 he began work at the tinner&#x27;s trade, and was thus engaged for two years. He
was thus engaged, for two years, as clerk in a drug store at Winchester and 1877, was appointed Deputy
Postmaster, under F. M. Way. In this capacity he proved efficient and obliging, winning the regard of
the public, and unconsciously gaining popularity for himself. In November 1878, there were thirteen
candidates for the position of Postmaster, Charles being the youngest among the number. Under the

circumstances, the Representative in Congress, General Browne, felt reluctant to make a selection or
recommendation, and it was accordingly decided to submit the matter to the people for adjustment. An
election followed, at which Charles received a flattering majority of all the votes cast, receiving thus a
well-merited testimonial to his ability and integrity. He was a member of the White River
Encampment, #50 at Winchester; also member and officer of the Knights of Pythias, Winchester Lodge
#91.</div>
