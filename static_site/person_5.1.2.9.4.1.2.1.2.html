            <div class="person-text">(5.1.2.9.4.1.2.1.2) MARY F. CROOKSTON born May 12, 1868 Cold Spring NY and died June 20,
1950 at her home on Townsend Ridge, Kent NY; attended the public school in Cold Spring; married

1st Charles E. Robinson {son of Eli &amp; Hannah (Kent)] born March 4, 1868 Kent NY and died May 6,
1931. Charles worked on farms in eastern Putnam County and purchased a farm on Townsend Ridge
where they lived. He was an exceptionally good farmer, fine neighbor and had a wide circle of friends
who were shocked to hear of his sudden death. He served as trustee of the former Townsend Ridge
school district for several years and was also a trustee of the Luddingtonville Baptist church. She
married second Michael Rose. All 3 are buried at Raymond Hill Cemetery, Carmel, NY. Michael
operated a roadside stand and small truck garden farm. Mary was a member of the Ludingtonville
Baptist Church for over a half century and in her younger days was active in the church work and
always ready to aid neighbors in the vicinity. Apparently no offspring.</div>
