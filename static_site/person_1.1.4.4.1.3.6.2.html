            <div class="person-text">(1.1.4.4.1.3.6.2) FLORENCE MAY CHRISTESON born October 15, 1887 at the
Quarderer House, Barron, Barron, WI and died August 22, 1987 at the Knapp Haven
Rest Home, Chetek WI, less than 2 months short of her 100th birthday; buried in
Wayside Cemetery, Barron WI. Florence graduated from the Barron High School in the
Modern Classical Course as opposed to the German or English course, in 1906 with an
average of 92.9, which was the third highest in a class of 13 students. A high school
graduate in Barron County in those days was considered qualified to teach all eight
grades in many country or rural schools, most of which were of the one room variety.
She taught in rural school near Prairie Farm WI for a time, but soon left that profession,
trained as a bookkeeper, and during WWI, was a bookkeeper in International Falls MN.
In the 1920 Census, is listed as a telephone operator. Later she returned to Barron to take

care of her mother who was in ill health and then as housekeeper for her father and
brother, Lester, after her mother died. She inherited the house after the death of her
father and resided in it until she entered the Knapp Haven Rest Home about 1985. She
was a member of the United Methodist Church and United Methodist Church Women in
Barron.</div>
