Compiled by Colonel Charles V. DeLand, &quot;DeLand&#x27;s History of Jackson County, Michigan,&quot; (B. F. Bowen, 1903), Edmund
Ferris biography, pp 646-648. It is with distinctive gratification that we incorporate in this volume a memoir of this honored
pioneer of Jackson County, for his name is held in lasting regard by all who knew him or have cognizance of his worthy and
useful life. Edmund Ferris was a native of the state of New York, having been born in the town of Genoa, Cayuga county, on
the 23rd of December, 1805, and being a son of James Armour and Annie (Brown) Ferris, the former of whom was born in
Greenwich, Connecticut, on the 13th of January, 1778, while the latter was born in the same town in Connecticut on the 21st
of January, 1780. She entered into eternal rest on the 9th of March, 1843, while her husband passed away on the 11th of
September, 1863. In the year 1793 James A Ferris, in company with his parents, five brothers and one sister, emigrated
from Connecticut to Cayuga County, New York, the family taking up their abode in the village of Genoa, where he was
reared to manhood and where his marriage was solemnized, his wife&#x27;s parents having likewise been early settlers of that
county. This worthy couple became the parents of eight children, namely: Ann, Elizabeth, Lewis, Deborah, Edmund,
Lucretia, Calista and Augustus. The original progenitor of the Ferris family in America was Jeffere Ferris, who came from
England and settled in Greenwich, Connecticut, in the year 1640. He was a descendant of Henir de Ferriers, a Norman, who
obtained from William the Conqueror large land grants in Staffordshire, Derbyshire and Leicestershire, England.
Edmund Ferris, subject of this memoir, was reared and educated in his native town, and there was solemnized, of the 8th of
April, 1834, his marriage to Miss Catherine Brown, who was born in Chester county, Pennsylvania, on the 26th of June,
1808, and in 1816 her parents emigrated thence to Cayuga county, New York, taking up their residence in the village of
Genoa, where she was reared to maturity. Her father, William Brown, was born September 21, 1767, and his death occurred
on the 24th of September, 1833. His wife, whose maiden name was Catherine Jones, was a resident of the city of
Philadelphia at the time of their marriage, which occurred in the year 1800. She died on the 14th of February, 1831. Their
children were as follows: Mary Ann, Joannah, William, Catherine, Elizabeth, Jane, Rebecka, Lydia and Sarah. In the year
1837, Edmund Ferris removed with his family from the old home in New York to Springport, Jackson County, Michigan,
where he became a pioneer farmer and a man of influence in the community, here continuing to reside until his death, which

occurred on the 10th of October, 1885. In the connection, the following is from an obituary notice published at the time of
his demise: &quot;Edmund Ferris, an old and retired resident of this township, died at noon on Saturday, October 10, 1885. The
deceased was born in the town of Genoa, Cayuga county, New York, December 23, 1805, and he came to Springport
township in the fall of 1836, locating the west half of section 20, where he reside at the time of his death, although he
disposed of a part of the original farm, upon which the village of Springport is now located, and purchased other tracts of
land. He wrought out a large and valuable farm. His first labor here was to assist in building the Mallory saw-mill, on
Spring brook, this being the first manufacturing concern of any description in the township. He built the first house with the
limits of Springport, near the present site of Mrs. Fitzgerald&#x27;s residence, and was obliged to walk four miles morning and
evening, to his nearest available boarding place, the home of Herman Landon. The dismal howl of the wolf often followed
him on his solitary walks through the forest and proved an unpleasant accompaniment. He was a man of sterling integrity
and assisted in the organization of the township, in 1838, and he held at various times all the places of honor and trust in the
power of his fellow townsmen to confer upon him. A widow and several grown sons and daughters survive him. One of his
sons Edward J. was a soldier in the war of the Rebellion and died in the notorious Libby prison pen. The funeral of this
honored pioneer too place at the family home at one o&#x27;clock Monday afternoon, October 12, Rev. H. P. Henderson
delivering a very appreciative address, from Ecclesiastes, ninth chapter and fifth verse.&quot;
In the ensuing paragraphs we make brief mention of the other representatives of the Ferris family who became prominently
identified with the history of Jackson County. Alanson Ferris was one of the early pioneers of Springport Township. He
was born in Genoa, Cayuga County, New York, on the 13th of December, 1814. His father, Lemuel Ferris, accompanied his
parents Greenwich, Connecticut, to Genoa in 1793, and in that locality settled upon a farm, which continued to be his home
during the remainder of his life. On the 4th of March, 1840, Alanson Ferris was united in marriage to Miss Olivia
Leavenworth, who was born in the same township in Cayuga County, New York, on the 9th of May, 1810. In 1842 Mr.
Ferris came to Jackson County and located on the farm in Springport Township, which continued to be his place of abode
until he was summoned into the life eternal, his death occurring on the 24th of January, 1898, while his devoted wife had
passed away on the 10th of November, 1890. They became the parents of four children, concerning whom we make a brief
record as follows: Henry, who was born on the 17th of August, 1841, died on the 30th of July, 1846; Adeline, who was born
on the 30th of May 1845, was married to Oscar Smith, September 12, 1866, and her death occurred on the 27th of
September, 1882, while she is survived by three children, Henry, Lillie and Rollin; Hiram L. Ferris, who was born on the 9th
of February, 1849, married Miss Ida St. Johns, of Ohio, and they are now residents of the state of Kansas; John who was
born February1, 1852, married Miss Rose Paine, of Springport township, and they now reside at Big Rapids, Michigan. Mr.
and Mrs. Ferris were folk of noble character and in their sterling qualities of character afforded an example well worthy of
emulation by succeesing generations. They celebrated their golden anniversary in 1890, and Mrs. Ferris&#x27; death occurred
only a few months later in the same year. Augustus Ferris Gaylord, son of Lucius and Ann (Ferris) Gaylord, was born in
Aurora, Cayuga County, New York, on the 11th of June 1806, and on the 2d of January, 1828, he was married to Lucretia
Ferris, daughter of James A Ferris. He came to Michigan in the company of his father in 1835, and located twenty-seven
and one-half lots in what is now the village of Springport, Jackson County. He then returned to New York, but in 1836
came again and here tarried several months, preparing for the removal of his family to the new home in the following
spring. Lewis (Augustus?) and Edmund Ferris, his brother-in-law, came on in the summer and purchased of him a portion
of the land which he has secured, and Edmund Ferris moved hither with his family in 1837, as has been previously noted in
this sketch. Mr. Gaylord brought his wife and four daughters from the old home in New York to the veritable wilderness of
Jackson County in the spring of the same year, and here he began in a literal sense to hew out a home in the midst of the
virgin forest. He built a house in what is now the northeast corner of the village of Springport, and there the family resided
for several years. In 1843 he exchanged these lands with John and William Oyer for a tract of land one-half mile north of
the village, the farm is now owned by William Brancroft. He was the father of eight daughters and one son, the latter being
the youngest of the family and dying at the age of two and one-half years. Mr. Gaylord removed with his family to Battle
Creek, Calhoun County, in 1852, and there his wife died on the 15th of January, 1856. On the 23rd of April, 1857, he
married Miss Maryette Beebe, and in 1865 he removed to Eaton county, thereafter residing in Eaton Rapids and vicinity
until his death, which occurred on the 15th of July 1888. He was appointed postmaster of Springport in 1838 and retained
this office until the time of his removal to Battle Creek.
