Obituary for Daniel S. Moore, Rockford Register, Thursday, January 11, 1917
ANOTHER PIONEER HASS PASSED TO HIS REWARD
Was an early Settler of the Township of Courtland
Went to California in early days
Was a man trusted and respected by his neighbors
Another of the pioneers of this section passed away Saturday at the home of his daughter, Mrs. Wm. Mourner, in the west
part of the village and in the passing of Daniel S. Moore the country loses one of those sturdy old men who has seen more
than his share of the country and one who merited the respect and confidence of his fellow men in his dealings with them
from day to day. The deceased was the son of Hiram and Maria Moore of Oakfield and was born Dec. 1, 1829 in Orange
County, N.Y. He spent his boyhood days in the town of Bath, N.Y., where he received his education. In the spring of 1847
he came to Michigan to help clear up a farm for his father and in 1852 he traveled the overland route across the plains to the
gold fields of California and Nevada. He returned home in 1853, crossing the two oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. In 1854
he bought a farm of 160 acres in Courtland and in 1856 was married to Miss Mary L. Addison of Courtland. To this union
was born six children - five daughters and one son. One daughter passed away on June 25, 1881 and his wife died October
9, 1901. In 1890 Mr. Moore and his wife moved to Rockford and lived in the house where he passed away January 6 at the
age of 87 years, one month and five days. He is survived by four daughters - Mrs. Emma Whittall of Algoma; Mrs. Lodica
Mourner of Rockford; Mrs. Harry Seeley of Cannon; and Mrs. Mabel Baker of Algoma; one son - James F. Moore of Grand
Rapids; a sister, Mrs. Hill of Oakfield and one brother. Besides these there are 23 grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren.
He was a memeber of the Methodist Episcopalian church and the funeral services were conducted by Rev. G.H. Hancock of
Hart. The internment was made in the Courtland Cemetery.
