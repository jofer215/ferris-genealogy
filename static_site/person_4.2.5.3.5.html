            <div class="person-text">(4.2.5.3.5) JERUSHA LOCKWOOD born August 14, 1790 Greenwich and died August 4, 1868
Bridgewater, Litchfield, CT; married November 1815 John Wooster [son of Peter &amp; Elizabeth
(Canfield) Wooster] born 1790 Bridgewater, Litchfield, CT and died there May 29, 1858; both buried
there, New Ground; He passed his youth on the farm attending the district school; and while a boy
nearly lost his life by a log which rolled on him, making an indentation in his skull, which affected his
brain. A piece of the skull bone was taken out, and a silver shilling placed under the skinn to protect the
brain, which piece always remained there, so that it could be said that he was never without a shilling.
He early commenced teaching scholl in the winter season, and soon attained to the credit of being one

of the best teachers of his day. After twenty-one years of age, he taught school winters and worked on
the farm summers, applying all his means to buying the interests of his sisters in his father&#x27;s farm. He
married Jerusha, daughter of David Lockwood. He thought much of his home and seemed most happy
when surrounded by his family, and enjoying the society of his friends and neighbors with whom he
always lived on the best of terms. In the prime of life he met with an accident which incapacitated him
for hard labor, by being thrown from a wagon and injuring one knee, but he almost constantly held
some public office in the town, which in some measure compensated for his inability to labor. He once
represented New Milford in the legislature. He was a prompt, punctual, upright business man, and was
entrusted with the settling of estates. He was constable, assessor, and selectman, the last so often the he
was sometimes called the &quot;Old Selectman.&quot; A year or two before his death, he went to live with his
daughter Susan at Bridgewater Centre, where he died as he had lived, with his children around him, on
May 29, 1858, aged 68 years. And born to them were:</div>
