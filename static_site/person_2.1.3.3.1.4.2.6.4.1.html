(2.1.3.3.1.4.2.6.5) GEORGE NOBLE WILLIAMSON born December 20, 1865 Olmsted Co MN and
died September 27, 1923; married April 15, 1896 Annie May Mackenzie born August 3, 185 St. Paul,
Ramsey, MN;
GEORGE N. WILLIAMSON has been successfully engaged in the practice of law in the city of Aberdeen, Brown county,
for the past twelve years, and is one of the representative members of the bar of the state. He is a native of the state of
Minnesota, having been born in Rochester, Olmsted county, on the 20th of December, 1865, and being a
son of Nathan N. and Mary Williamson, the former of whom was born in the state of New York and the latter in New
England, while they were numbered among the pioneers of Minnesota, the father having been for many years engaged in the
contracting business at Rochester. The subject received his early educational discipline in the public schools of
Oronoco and Rochester, Minnesota, and then entered the law department of the University of Minnesota. He was admitted
to the bar of his native state in 1889 and the same year to that of the new commonwealth of South Dakota, since he located
in Aberdeen in 1892 and here initiated the active work of his profession, in which he has been most successful, being an
able trial lawyer and a duly conservative counselor, he is a close student of his profession and gives careful preparation to
every cause which he presents before court or jury. In politics he is an independent Republican and while he takes an active
interest in public affairs and in the success of the party cause, he has never been ambitious for political office. He has
attained the thirty-second degree in the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite Masonry, and is also identified with the Knights of
Pythias. On the 15th of April, 1896, Mr. Williamson was married to Miss May M. Mackenzie, who was born in the city of
St. Paul, Minnesota, on the 3d of August, 1875, being a daughter of Alexander C. and Annie Mackenzie. Of this union have
been born three children, Alan N., Marjorie and Helen.
