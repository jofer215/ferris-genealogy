            <div class="person-text">(5.1.2.9.2.5.2.2) NATHANIEL T. BAXTER born 1855 and died October 11, 1919; married Asenath J.
Tompkins [dau of Gouvernor Tompkins and Samantha (Curry)] born 1855 and died August 10, 1919;
both buried Tompkins Corners Cemetery, Putnam Valley NY. (1900 Census-2 children-1 living)
Obituary, Putnam Courier, Carmel, NY, Friday, Oct. 17, 1919: Nathaniel T. Baxter, a life long and
highly esteemed resident of Putnam Valley died at his home on Saturday morning, Oct. 11, 1919, at 7
a.m. at the age of 64 years and 14 days. He had been a sufferer from heart trouble for a number of years
but bore it with Christian fortitude. While engaged in family prayer the messenger came and called him
home. He was a blessing to the community in which he lived. He has enriched the lives of all that knew
him and will be remembered as a neighbor full of kindly deeds and helpful impulses. As a member of
the Tompkins Corners M.E. Church, when health permitted, he was a regular attendant and a
dependable helper in its work and served as a steward for many years. In politics, he was an ardent
republican having held the office of Assessor for a number of terms, which office he held at the time of
his death. His word was a good as his bond. He was an active member of the Putnam Valley Grange.
He leaves to mourn his loss his only child, Susan, wife of Harold Wixon, who has been so devoted in
caring for him; two sisters, Angeline, wife of Robert Barker, and Sarah, wife of Hezekiah Tompkins;
also a number of nieces and nephews. The heartfelt sympathy of the community goes out to this family,
especially to the daughter who was so dear to him. Obituary, Putnam Courier, Carmel, NY, Friday, Aug.
22, 1919: Mrs. Asenath J. Baxter, wife of Nathaniel Baxter, died at her home on Sunday night, Aug. 10,
1919, at ten o&#x27;clock, aged 63 years. Mrs. Baxter was taken at about six o&#x27;clock with a violent headache.
Dr. Holla was called and responded at once but after the doctor left she grew worse. The doctor was
telephoned for again but before he came she had entered into rest. Her death was caused by cerebral
hemorrhage. She was a member of the Tompkins Corners M.E. church for many years. She leaves to
mourn her loss, her husband, who has been in poor health for a number of years. She has been faithful
in caring for him, ever thoughtful and careful for his needs. One daughter, Susan, wife of Harold H.
Wixon, who lives at home with her father; five brothers, Hezekiah, William H., and Isaac Tompkins, of
Tompkins Corners; Lewis Tompkins, of Van Cortlandville, and George Tompkins, of Patterson; one
sister, Mrs. Mary Smith, of Mahopac Falls, and several nieces and nephews. They have the heartfelt
sympathy of the entire community. Deceased was a fine type of womanhood, earnest and active in

every good work, amiability and consideration for others being marked traits of her character. She lived
up to high ideals, cheerfulness and helpfulness being the rules of her life. Her kind-heartedness and
sympathetic nature won her many friends. Her thoughtful remembrances and kind acts to the sick will
long be remembered and cherished. Her mission was fulfilled but she will be missed and mourned not
only by her relatives, but also by a wide circle of friends, who loved and appreciated her true worth as a
woman. She is no doubt enjoying His presence now and while we mourn her departure, it is with the
thought that the reunion awaits us in the future, if we are willing to accept Him who said &quot;I am the way,
the truth, the life; no man cometh to the Father but by Me&quot; Burial was in the family plot at Tompkins
Corners Cemetery. Born to them was:</div>
