            <div class="person-text">(2.1.1.3.3) ESTHER PALMER born in 1745 and married in August 1779 Peter Sackett [son of Dr.
Joseph &amp; Hannah (Alsop) Sackett] born in 1757. Peter born and spent his boyhood days at Newtown
on Long Island. In the same town dwelt Esther Palmer dau of Mr. Charles Palmer, a prominent and

a private soldier. When he returned at the end of the campaign he was the Sergeant Major of his

held by the British. In November 1776, the New York troops were re-organized and Lieutenant Colonel
Henry B. Livingston was commissioned Colonel and Sergeant Major Peter Sackett, Adjutant of the
4th Regiment of the Continental Line. Peter left the service in 1779 and he and Esther were married.
They sailed on a wedding tour to Europe and remained there until the war was over. On returning to
