            <div class="person-text">(5.1.3.4.3.1.2) WILLIAM DARIUS BISHOP born September 14, 1827 Bloomfield, Essex, NJ and died
February 4, 1904; interred Mountain Grove Cemetery (Photo), Bridgeport CT. After he graduated from
Yale 1849, he soon became a director of the Naugatuck Railroad; he was the first superintendent of this
road and then in 1855 was chosen to its presidency. He was a Democratic U. S. Representative from
Connecticut, 1857-59, the 35th Congress; and when he failed to get reelected, was appointed United
States commissioner of patents by President Buchanan. During his brief service as commissioner
(1859-60), he is said to have done good service, especially in putting in order the Patent Office records
and in systematizing the work of his subordinates. In May 1866, he left the Presidency of the
Naugatuck to take up that of the New York and New Haven. Under his regime, the New York &amp; New
Haven acquired both the Hartford &amp; Connecticut Valley and the Harlem &amp; Port Chester, and leased the
Shore Line. With this consolidation, the road became increasingly powerful. During William&#x27;s
administration, the New York &amp; New Haven system gained an ascendancy it never lost. While he was
executive head of this system, he was admitted to the Fairfield County Bar, 1870; represented
Bridgeport in the General Assembly, 1872; state senator, 1866, 1877, 1878; and had a conspicuous part
in general railway legislature. He made extensive and thoroughgoing improvements in local railroad
conveniences at Bridgeport. He was a director of the Bridgeport Steamboat Company, operating
between Bridgeport and New York; also of the Housatonic Railroad, extending from Bridgeport to
Pittsfield MA. In March 1879 he retired from the presidency of the New York &amp; New Haven, but until
his death he remained on the board of directors. In 1883, he was once more called to be president of the
Naugatuck and held this office until his retirement in October 1903. He married, in 1850, Julia A.
Tomlinson of Bridgeport. Born to them was (and possibly more):
