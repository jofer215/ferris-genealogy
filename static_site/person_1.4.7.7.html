            <div class="person-text">(1.4.7.7) ANNA FERRIS (Photo) born December 8, 1771 Westchester (Throggs Neck]
and died November 5, 1854 Newburgh NY; married, May 7, 1794 at Flushing Meeting
(Quaker ceremony), Valentine Seaman, M.D. [son of Willett &amp; Mary (Searing) Seaman]
[or 4th son of Samuel] born (March) April (March) 2, 1770 North Hempstead, L.I., NY
and died June 27 (July 3), 1817 NY. Both Anna and Valentine were of the Society of
Friends. Received his M.D. from University of Philadelphia, 1792; studied medicine
with Dr. Romayne, and was a surgeon of the New York Hospital from 1796 to his death.
They made their home on Beekman Street across from the Old Brick Church. It was a
large home surrounded with gardens and vineyards. It was here they lost their first child
Betsy to smallpox. This tragedy induced Valentine to visit Dr. Edward Jenner in
England, the result of which brought Valentine home with the serum and a close friend
for life. His son became the first white child vaccinated in this country. Controversey
was raised over the use of the vaccine and almost cost him his medical career. After
much debate and effort on the part of Valentine, he was finally given permission to
vaccinate his own family and volunteers from the poor house. He was conspicuous in
the introduction of vaccination in New York. He was a prominent physician and surgeon
of NYC; President of the Medical Society which was the forerunner of the New York
College of Physicians and Surgeons. Dr. Seaman was the first to have a class of women
to instruct in the care of midwifery, writing a book for their instruction and guidance;
this was at the Alms House in New York. He also published an account of yellow fever,
which prevailed in 1791 and 1800; this may yet be found in the Medical Repository.
Besides being the first analyst of the waters of Saratoga and Balston Springs, he wrote
an exhaustive treatise on the suject. In 1810-11 he and others formed a medical
institution associated with Queens College in New Brunswick NJ. He was an active
member of the Manumission Society for the liberation of slaves and their protection. He
published Inaugural Address on Opium, Philadelphia, 1792; Midwife’s Monitor,
1800; On Vaccination, 1816; and a pharmacopia. Valentine’s health began to decline

about a year before his death from consumption in 1817. Dr. Seaman’s portrait hangs
proudly in the boardroom of New York City Hospital where he was their first operating
surgeon. Valentine’s made his will August 22, 1815 in New York City. “I, Valentine
Seaman, of the city of New York, physician, do make and publish this, my last will and
