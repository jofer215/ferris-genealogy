            <div class="person-text">(4.5.2.1.2) DEBORAH REYNOLDS (#647) born May (13) 24, 1766 and died May 15, 1857; married
Frederick Lockwood (#323) (4.4.5.5); see him for offspring.

(4.5.2.1.3) SARAH REYNOLDS (#648) born October 16, 1747 and died February 9, 1842. Sarah was
raised on her father’s farm in Stanwich, near Long Island Sound. An anecdote has it that the British and
the Tories went to Sarah’s father’s farm to drive away his cattle; Sarah unterrified by the presence of
the marauders, ran out of the house and drove the cattle back to their quarters. In a few days, the enemy
apparently recovered their courage, made another raid upon the cattle, when the dauntless girl, again,
came to the rescue, whereupon the leader of the band commanded her to leave or he would fire upon
her. ‘Fire then!’ was reply, when he turned to his men and said, ‘Let her have them’; her courage and
intrepidity having secured her father’s property from further molestation. She married, February 1,
1770, Peter Knapp (2.6.4.7); see him for offspring.</div>
