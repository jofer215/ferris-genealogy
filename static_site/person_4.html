            <div class="person-text">(4)MARY FERRIS (Marah) (AFN:378X-C5)
only daughter of Jeffrey, born c1640 (1637?) (if the 1637 birth date is correct, then Mary was the third
born of Jeffrey&#x27;s children) (LDS says she born February 6, 1640) (Mary was referred to as Mercy in
one family chart) and died 1707/8 Greenwich CT; married 1st 1662 (LDS says they married January 6,
1664 at Stamford) First Lieutenant Jonathan Lockwood (AFN:8RKK-D1) (son of Robert and Susannah
(Norman)) born September 10, 1634 Watertown MA and died May 12, 1688 Greenwich CT. [Jeffrey
was Jonathan’s stepfather and father-in-law; Mary would have been his step-sister!] Jonathan became a
freeman at Greenwich in 1670; was assistant May 1671 and 1672; was one of the twenty-seven
proprietors. Jonathan was from Fairfield (Stamford?) CT and served as a State Representative for four
years and was one of the leading influential citizens, and commandant of the military forces of the
town. Gershom Lockwood was a brother of Jonathan. (Jim - Jonathan Lockwood’s mother was Mary’s
stepmother- her father’s second wife, so Mary’s stepmother was her mother-in-law!!!!!) This marriage
brought together the families of Ferris and Lockwood and was the first of a very long series of unions
between these families down the years. Mary and Jonathan established their home in Greenwich CT,
where he became one of the most, if not the most, prominent citizens of the town. When Jonathan died
the people of Greenwich met in town meeting and passed a resolution deploring the loss of so valuable
a citizen. Mary married 2d June 5, 1696, as his third wife, Sergeant Thomas Merritt of Rye NY who
died 1721 [son of Thomas Merritt, Sr., of Rye]. By the end of 1699, Thomas, Sr. had acquired most of
the upper part of Barton’s Neck, and thus, it became known as Merrit’s Point.] [Thomas Merritt agreed
to support Mary’s children from the Lockwood marriage, June 18, 1696.](LDS says Mary married three
times; 1st to Jonathan Lockwood; 2d to Lt. Jonathan Lockwood; and third to Thomas Merritt.) Born to
Mary and Jonathan were:
Note: The (#) after the Lockwood names are the assigned numbers from the Lockwood Book.
Note: After I had entered the entire Jonathan Lockwood line, I became aware of the fact that the
Lockwood Book has been called, by many, a ‘genealogical atrocity’, particularly the first 3-5
generations. I will attempt to locate additional references that correct this ‘atrocity’, but I wanted
everyone to know, that the following is open to further research. Thanks to Fred Knapp for calling this
to my attention. Please consider yourself warned!</div>
