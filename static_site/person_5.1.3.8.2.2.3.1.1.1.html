AIR CRASH KILLS WILLIAMS MAN Williams, Sept. 14 (AP) --- A routine flight in a new one-place
Mooney monoplane ended in tragedy Friday for Stewart S. Bassett, 28, Williams Jeweler. He was
killed instantly when the plane went out of control 16 miles north of Ash Fork and crashed into a cedar
covered hillside. The watch on his arm had stopped at 9:09. Thomas E. Way, Williams Justice of the
Peace and Coroner, said Bassett had flown to a sandstone quarry in that area on a business matter
concerning sale of a house trailer he owned there. He said Bassett dropped a note to the man he wanted
to contact and began circling about 100 yards above the ground. Suddenly the craft nosed into a dive.
Way said a coroner&#x27;s jury taken to the scene returned a verdict of accidental death. Bassett was the
operator of Bassetts Jewelry. He was part owner of the plane. It was purchased about three weeks ago.
He leaves a wife and small son.
Services Held Tuesday for Stewart S. Bassett
A shocked hush fell on Williams Friday when news of Stewart Bassett’s fatal plane crash was
reported... The hurt deepened through Tuesday afternoon when business houses up and down the length
of Bill Williams Avenue closed their establishments during the services. Last rites were held at 2
o&#x27;clock at the Methodist Church, followed by a military gravesite service in charge of Sgt-at-arms
Herbert Sherman, Cordova Post 13, American Legion. H.E. Walker of the Williams Funeral Home
directed arrangements in general.
Seldom has a young man, Stewart would have been 28 this October, made so many warm friends in
a few half dozen years since he cam to make his home at Williams. Well rounded, with gifts of charm,
light heartedness and generosity plus, a touch of genius, he gave of his time unsparingly to promote
community projects. The Methodist church filled to overflowing while Miss Fern Rigg played an organ
prelude. The Reverend Milton Winkler recited the 23rd Psalm, a favorite of Stewart&#x27;s mother, and
following a prayer, gave readings from the Old and New Testaments. Miss Kathryn Sutherland,
accompanied by Miss Rigg, then sang the beautiful “Lord’s Prayer”. After words of commendation on
Stewart Bassett&#x27;s life, the Benediction was spoken and the American Legion took over with John
Williams, first vice commander of Williams Cordova Post 13, James King, adjutant, and Herbert
Sherman, Sgt.-at-Arms. Bassett was accorded one of the most impressive military rites Williams has
ever seen. Between 75 to 100 Legionnaires from here and elsewhere, most in uniform, marched to do
him honor. Led by the color guard, the pallbearers followed. Slowly the cortege marched westward on
Sherman to Fifth thence to the cemetery. Here prayers were read by Chaplain W.E. DeVaney, of the
local Post, followed by a Benediction by Chaplain Hollingsworth of Flagstaff&#x27;s
Mark A. Moore Post. The firing squad then, fired a salute after which Henry Rigg sounded taps on his
bugle, with Lloyd Webb playing the echo. An American flag was presented to Stewart&#x27;s widow, Mrs.
Colleen Bassett, by Chaplain DeVaney, after which the beautiful floral wreath -- yellow star against a
background of blue chrysanthemums -- gift of American Legion&#x27;s Cordova Post 13, was placed at the
foot of the grave. Besides the great body of local Legionnaires present, thirty or more from the Mark A.
Moore Post, Flagstaff, were represented, including Commander Ole Solberg and Past State Commander
Ray Rochnow; District Commander C.R. Waters of Kingman; and State Adjutant Clayton Orth of
Phoenix.

The accident occurred early Friday morning about 16 miles northwest of Ash Fork. Stewart&#x27;s new
plane crashed against a tree. He had been circling, trying to rise after throwing a note to a man about a
trailer.
A member here of the Lions club and the Odd Fellows, an aviation machinist&#x27;s mate in World War
II, Stewart S. Bassett was Commander of the local American Legion, Cordova Post 13. His jewelry
store on Bill Williams will be carried on by his widow. Affairs of the Lazy SB ranch will be wound
up by Logan Tuthill, Momence, Ill. Besides his wife and their young son, Charles, 2 1/2, Stewart is
survived by his father, Stewart Bassett, Sr., of Oak Park, ILL, his mother, Mrs. Logan Tuthill,
Momence, ILL; and his grandmother, Mrs. Rollo S. Bassett who is a sister of Mrs. H.L. Benham, Sr.
WILLIAMS NEWS Front Page, September 1951
An airplane crash 16 miles north of Ash Fork last Friday morning, resulted in the death of Stewart S.
Bassett, 28, proprietor of Bassett&#x27;s Jewelry Shop, 215 W. Bill Williams Ave. Bassett was flying a onepassenger plane, a Mooney, which he and Larry Ely had purchased a short time before. He was thought
to have been trying to deliver a message to Went Murphy who operates a quarry north of Ash Fork, as
he had circled the quarry and was flying low at the time of the accident. Mr. and Mrs. Murphy observed
him and stated that in banking sharply for another turn, the plane seemed to go out of control and
crashed into the forest of big junipers, which surround the quarry. The plane was completely
demolished, and was strewn over a strip of the woods some two hundred feet in length. Murphy was
not far away, and hurried to the wrecked plane, fearing that at any moment fire might break out. He
found Bassett&#x27;s body pinned beneath the gas tank, with gasoline pouring out breaks in the tank, but the
gas had not ignited. He felt the victim&#x27;s pulse and found there was none at all. A hasty glance at the
body showed the head crushed, and it was plain that death had been instantaneous. Murphy then
returned to the trailer and used his pickup in order to reach a telephone in Ash Fork and report the
tragedy to Williams. Upon receiving word of the crash, Justice of the Peace and Ex-officio Coroner
Thomas E. Way immediately impaneled a jury and drove to the scene. Coroner and jury examined the
wreckage and removed the body to an ambulance. They found that Bassett&#x27;s watch had stopped at 9:09
thus giving the exact time of the tragedy. The jury&#x27;s verdict reads, &quot;accidental death as a result of an
airplane accident.&quot;
