            <div class="person-text">(5.1.3.8) NATHANIEL FERRIS born March 27, 1746 Greenwich CT and died August 6, 1823
Greenwich; a Private in Captain George Peck&#x27;s Company of Colonel John Mead&#x27;s Regiment of Militia
at Greenwich from November 1, 1776 to January 23, 1777, being discharged after serving 2 months
and 23 days. About 1792, Nathaniel built the colonial farmhouse in Greenwich, which became known
as KEOFFERAM LODGE and stood on the Jeffrey Ferris home site. He married, December 15, 1784,
as her third husband, Mary (Johnson) (Ferris) Peck (4.4.11.1), and widow of Joshua Ferris (3.6.1.2), and
also widow of Thomas Peck (3.10.2.13). They both were buried at Old Sound Beach Cemetery,
Greenwich. Mrs. Anderson&#x27;s favorite story of her great-grandfather was that after the birth of his
second child he greatly feared that he, too, would die as Mary&#x27;s two former husbands had, after the
birth of a son and a daughter by each of them and that his mind was not completely relieved until they
had four more children. Mary was remembered by her granddaughter, Maria Ferris Keeler, as a
handsome, vivacious woman, with sparkling dark eyes, who had great energy, was quick in her actions,
and kept perfect discipline among her children and grandchildren. After Nathaniel&#x27;s death Mary was

considered the wealthiest woman in Old Greenwich as she had acquired large and prosperous farms
from each of her three husbands. Born to them were {and all baptized in the Episcopal Church of
Stamford, March 23, 1979}:</div>
