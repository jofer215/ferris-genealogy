            <div class="person-text">(5.1.3.1.7.2.6.1.3) LILLIE E. HAYMAKER born September 25, 1866 Franklin, Portage, OH; like her
sisters, she attended the school in Earlville; and then college at Akron, 3 years, with 1 year’s previous
attendance at the high school of the city; married March 11, 1891 at her father&#x27;s home in Franklin,
Herbert A. Swan (Bert) born January 20, 1856 Kent OH (January 20, 1866 Everett, Summit, OH).
Herbert&#x27;s father was a farmer, and his son has always followed the same occupation. When about a year
old his father moved onto a farm in the southwest part of Streetsboro, where he lived some 5 years;
then moved into Kent, where he resided a few years; then moved out onto a farm he had purchased,
about a mile from town, which was his home until his marriage. He was educated, principally, in the
schools of Kent OH. After their marriage they moved onto a farm of 90 acres, one-half of which he
eventually owned. He farmed the place with the intention of purchasing the other half.</div>
