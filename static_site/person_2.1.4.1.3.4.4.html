            <div class="person-text">(2.1.4.1.3.4.4) WILLIAM W. SEARL born December 29, 1843 IL and died September 29, 1905 IL;
married Cynthia J. Blood born March 11, 1847 and died March 13, 1899; both buried Grove Cemetery,
Elmira Township, Stark Co IL. From Scott Ferris’ webpage: “William was a member of Company I.,
139th Illinois Infantry during the Civil War, registering in Toulon IL. Adjutant’s Report: The One
Hundred and Thirty-ninth Infantry was mustered into the United States services as a one hundred-day
Regiment, at Peoria, on the 1st day of June, 1864, and on the 8th of June, it moved for St. Louis by
steamboard, arriving there on the 10th; thence it moved to Columbus KY, where it remained about a
week, when it was moved to Cairo as a garrison for that place. Here the Regiment remained until
August with but little to disturb the monotony of camp life. About the 1st of August, a guerrilla party
had captured some steamboats a short distance above Paducah, and took from them several hundred
cattle and horses. General Payne, who was then commanding the Department of Northern Kentucky,
ordered Colonel Davison to take 400 of his men and go and take from the rebel farmers living in the
counties adjoining the Ohio River, where the capture was made, as many cattle and horses as had been
taken from the boats. Some of the stock was recaptured, and enough others taken as directed to make
good the loss. Two or three of the ringleaders of the guerrilla party were also captured. After the return
of this expedition the Regiment remained at Cairo doing garrison duty until the 25th of September. It
was then moved to Peoria to be mustered out of service. But the time had not come yet. General Price
with a lare rebel force was marching towards St. Louis, and there were not enough troops to defend it
that could be spared from other places. President Lincoln therefore sent a dispatch to Colonel Davison
requesting him to take his Regiment and go at once to St. Louis. The President was aware that the
Regiment had already served beyond the time for which it was enlisted. As soon as the circumstances
were explained to the men they were ready to go. For this prompt response, the President wrote a letter
to the men of the Regiment, expressing his thanks and commending them for their patriotism. Going by
rail to St. Louis the Regiment marched out in the direction of Franklin to meet General Price. Several
other Regiments joining in the march the rebel General soon decided it was to his advantage to move to
the southern part of the State. The Union troops followed as fast as possible but failed to catch him.

Having driven him to a remote part of the State the Regiment was again moved to Peoria, where it was
mustered out of service on the 25th of October, 1984, having been in the service nearly five months”.</div>
