died December 3, 1873 Brooklyn NY of an infected tooth; buried Green-Wood
Cemetery, Brooklyn, Kings, NY; married 1818 at Peekskill, Thomas Joseph Blakeney
(Photo) [eldest of 7 sons of Thomas &amp; Catherine (Mildeberger) Blakeney] born January
12, 1796 New York City, near Trinity Church, and died November 7, 1877 Brooklyn
NY; buried in Trinity Church NY (Greenwood where a single stone marks the place of
his burial and that of his wife). He was a Methodist Episcopal - converted to Christianity
in the John Street Methodist Episcopal Church, when he was 18 years old. Thomas was
a Gold Pen manufacturer as were his son sons Joseph and Edward. Thomas purchased
five acres of land in Cortlandt Town on the Crumpound Road, from his father-in-law,
Joseph Ferris, but in 1836, he, with his wife, sold it to James Brown. It was on the east
side of the Ferris farm. After the death of her parents they went to live in the old Ferris
homestead, which later became the property of Rev. Henry Ward Beecher. Thomas was
an active worker in the cause of temperance while at Peekskill; he never used tobacco or
alcohol; never known to use slang word or swear. Lydia converted to Methodism {from
Episcopal} when she married Thomas.

Thomas Joseph Blakeney, my father, born in the vicinity of Trinity Church, New York
City, in 1796, and was the eldest of the seven sons of Thomas Blakeney and Catherine
Milderberger. I often think of New York as it was then and is now. In our later
generations when the children would complain of the cold, father would say &quot;Cold?
why, when I was a boy I used to go a long distance for fire, when the cold would freeze
the door knobs to my hands.&quot; My father was converted to Christianity in the John Street
Methodist Episcopal Church when 18 years of age. That old landmark still stands, a relic
of the religious zeal and steadfast devotion of those whose Christian traits of character
and example will never be forgotten. It was while he was leading a Methodist
Conference Meeting in Peekskill, N. Y., that my mother first met him, and I have heard
her remark that the religious fervor in one so young helped win her love and admiration.
In the year 1818, at the age of 22 years, Thomas Blakeney was married to Lydia Amelia
Ferris of Peekskill, N. Y., and together they lived a life consecrated to the religion they
professed. Nine children, all born in Peekskill-on-the-Hudson, were the fruits of their
union, and of these I will speak later. My father, Thomas J. Blakeney, was an active
worker in the cause of temperance while at Peekskill. He never used tobacco or
alcoholic drinks, never was known to use a slang word or to swear. He always cherished
a firm trust in God, and yet sweeping financial reverses was his experience, which
changed his home from Peekskill to New York, to again enter life&#x27;s maelstrom. My
mother, Lydia Amelia Ferris, was a convert to Methodism when she married my father.
The Ferris family were Episcopalians and my mother was confirmed in the church in her
early life. &quot;None knew her but to love her, none named her but to praise.&quot; Faith, Hope
and Charity were the three graces that seemed to surround her daily life. &quot;Willing to go
or willing to stay&quot; was her repeated expression during severe illness. Always a student of
the Bible, she courted argument with a modest retiring nature that always won her
respect. She was buried from First Place Church in Brooklyn and her pastor, Rev. A. S.
Hunt, officiating, took as his text 1st Corinthians, 15 Chap. 57th verse, &quot;But thanks be to
God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.&quot;
