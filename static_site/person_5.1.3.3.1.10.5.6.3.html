An email from Bob:

Hello Jim,
I was watching a TV documentary on Ireland last night and it reminded me that Ferris is an Irish name. It’s also a Scottish
name. But of course I know that Jeffrey Ferris came from England. Craig Ferris, an acquaintance in Tulsa (no relative),
told me of the Ferris Castle about 2 or 3 miles out of Kilarney, Ireland. It is a National Monument. It was destroyed by
Cromwell in 1652 in the English invasion of Ireland. Craig said that a photographer by the name of Ferris has a nice studio
on the main street of Kilarney, and that a Richard Ferris took Craig and his wife on a horse drawn carriage tour of Kilarney.
When Sally and I were in Edinborough, Scotland one time I looked at the Ferris names in the phone book and found a Rev.
John Ferris. Since we have a son John I decided to call. The Rev. was out of town, but Mrs. Ferris invited us over for tea.
We went and had an interesting visit. She said she and her husband were both born and reared in Ireland; they had been
missionaries in India, as Sally&#x27;s parents had been, and their children had gone to the same British boarding school that Sally
had attended. Also, in Edinborough I stopped in a woolen shop where there were neckties with the various Scottish plaids. I
asked the clerk if there was a Ferris plaid. He said no but that there was a Ferguson plaid and that the Fergusons and the
Ferrrises were cousins, so I should buy a Ferguson tie. I thought he was &quot;pulling my leg&quot; to sell a tie but I bought one
anyway, as I liked it. Awhile back I was browsing through a book in the Tulsa genealogical library on Scottish history and it
said that the Ferrises and Fergusons were cousins. The maiden name of my great grandmother, wife of Andrew Ferris, was
Ferguson. I just wanted to tell my story, and hope it’s of some interest to another Ferris. Bob
