            <div class="person-text">(5.1.2.9.6.2.3) SELAH ARMSTRONG born April 15, 1840 (in the old Armstrong homestead in
Peekskill Hollow) Putnam Valley and died June 17, 1916 at his home in Peekskill; was educated in the
district schools and Peekskill Military School; a farmer; justice of the peace for 4 years and elected
supervisor of Putnam Valley 1886; married October 22, 1862 Margaret Cole [dau of William &amp; Hester
Marie (Smith)] born October 12, 1834 (Canopus) Putnam Valley and died April 18, 1917 at her home at
300 Highland Avenue; both buried Hillside Cemetery. Margaret was a member of the Canopus M.E.
Church and was one of its active workers and retained her membership there until her death. She was
noted for her many womanly virtues and had a host of friends who mourned her loss. Selah remained at
home until was 21 years old, meantime attending the country school and later for 2 years a student at
the Peekskill Military Academy. After leaving school he went to New York City and for 2 years was in
the Rueben Smith carpet store, one of the big New York mercantile establishments of that day. He
returned to Peekskill and bought the property overlooking Oscawana Lake, where for years he
conducted a high-class summer boarding house. During the many years he was in charge of that place,
he looked after thousands and thousands of out of town people, many from New York and Brooklyn,
who sought the good air and the quiet atmosphere of Lake Oscawana. He had a continued and thorough
success of his summer hotel. In the fall he always moved back into Peekskill and resided in the village
until the call of the early arbutus and the first hepaticas drew him back to his summer home and its
pleasant duties by the lake, which he loved so well. He later sold the property and came to Peekskill to
reside. Selah was one of the best-known citizens of Putnam Valley and of later years Peekskill; member
of the Canopus M.E. Church. In politics he had always been a staunch and unswerving Democrat. He
early took an active interest in Putnam County politics. For many years he was the Democrat leader of

Putnam Valley. He was elected a justice of the peace soon after his return from New York City and
served several terms. He was elected the supervisor from Putnam Valley for several terms. For years, it
was his ceaseless labor and keen political leadership that held Putnam Valley in the Democratic
column, despite herculean efforts on the part of the Republican machine to wrest it from the party of
Jefferson and Jackson, Hill and Cleveland. When he became a resident of Peekskill, he was annually
importuned by the party leaders to accept a nomination on the town or village ticket, but steadfastly
refused to stand until he reluctantly consented to run on the Democratic ticket for water commissioner.
Despite the fact that he made no great fight for the place, he ran very well indeed, ahead of the ticket,
but went down to defeat with all his fellow nominees at the charter election. He belonged to but two
fraternities, the Grange and the Free Mason – Cortlandt Lodge No. 34 and Grange No. 841. He was the
bone and sinew of the Clinton Construction Company and he personally superintended the big
standpipe and installed the high-pressure system for the Peekskill water works. He also built the dam,
impounded Lake Mitchell, built the fences and the roads in Depew Park. He was a director of the
Westchester &amp; Putnam Railroad Company until it was sold to Stratton Interests in 1913. He was also
interested and always a director of the Westchester &amp; Putnam Trolley &amp; Land Improvement Company.
He was one of those sturdy citizens of the old school of unsullied character; honest to the core, square
as a brick, companionable in his nature and a friend to everyone who would be his friend. Whatever he
undertook at any time or anywhere, business, fraternal, social, religious, or political, he put his whole
heart into the game. He was unselfish, quiet, unostentatious, unassuming and these very traits brought
to him the vast number of admiring and steadfast friends. Born to them were:</div>
