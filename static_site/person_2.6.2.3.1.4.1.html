            <div class="person-text">(2.6.2.3.1.4.1) CHARLES A. WEED (Photo) born May 13, 1826 Stamford and died there November
10, 1897; married c1847 Abigail Smith Lounsbury [dau of Samuel &amp; Betsey (Weed) Lounsbury] born
October 14, 1826 CT and died June 20, 1882 Stamford; both buried Woodland Cemetery; from History
of Stamford: had been living in Richmond about nine years when the southern rebellion opened, and
had about $15,000 invested in his business. As he would not renounced his alligence to the government
of the United States, the local authorities took possession of his property and gave him a few hours to
leave the city with his family. He accepted the terms and removed his family again to Stamford,
preferring even poverty, if it must be so, to treason. When at length in the progress of our Union armies,
General Butler had taken possession of New Orleans and the surrounding country, Mr. Weed was at
liberty to avail himself of the advantages offered to loyal citizens. He had been despoiled by the
rebellion of his entire property, and the chance was now offered to him to wrest from the rebellion
many times his loss. He found on reaching New Orleans, in July 1862, the large plantations of the
neighborhood covered with crops, which the fugitive planters had sown, now neglected and in danger

of being utterly lost. Under governmental protection he went to the work of gathering in the crops. He
hired negroes who had been abandoned by their masters, giving to the government one half of the
products secured, and abundantly indemnifying himself for the losses he had sustained in Richmond.
Since then he has been engaged in business in New Orleans, where he has had an extensive
commission house under the firm of C. A. Weed &amp; Co. His enterprise is also shown in other ways. He
found the old New Orleans Cresent in a bankrupt condition, purchased it, and substituting for it the
New Orleans Times, has built up the largest and one of the most successful newspaper enterprises of the
South. He was also the original mover of the First National Bank of the city, and the largest stockholder
in it. He was offered the presidency of it, but refused. He, also, projected the New Orleans Fire
Insurance Company, which has also grown to be an institution of great local value. Born to them were:</div>
