            <div class="person-text">(5.1.3.1.5.1.8) JAMES MONROE FERRIS born February 23, 1832 Columbus NY and died
December 29, 1923 Frederika IA; married June 7, 1856 at Earlville NY, Frances &quot;Fannie&quot; J. Dutcher
born June 7, 1837 Ithaca NY and died July 5, 1917 Frederika IA. James enlisted, at Smyrna NY,
January 11, 1864, as a Private in Company H., NY 5th Heavy Artillery for 3 years, at the age of 31.
James received a bounty of $323.00 for his enlistment. He was involved in the following engagements:
the Defense of Washington, Piedmont VA; Lexington VA; Buchanan; Liberty; Salem; Harpers Ferry;
Lynchburg; Snickers Ferry; Martinsburg; Winchester VA; Charleston WVA; Halltown VA; Berryville;
Opeguan Creek; Fishers Hill; and Cedar Creek. At the battle of Cedar Creek, on October 19, 1864,
James became a POW; he was moved to Richmond and taken to Libby Prison. As fate would have it,
James spent only 3 days at the infamous Libby Prison, before he was transferred to Pemberton Prison
where he spent the next four months. He was paroled from Pemberton, February 15, 1865 and was
mustered out of the Army, June 10, 1865 at Harpers Ferry WVA. James and Fannie left Chenango
