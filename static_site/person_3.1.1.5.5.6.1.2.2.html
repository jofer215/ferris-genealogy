            <div class="person-text">(3.1.1.5.5.6.1.2.2) BEULAH MILES WOOD born August 7, 1881 and died May 12, 1959 Petersburg
IL; cemetery photo
&quot;Announcement was made Wednesday evening by the County Board, of their appointment
of Miss Beulah Wood, at present Principal of the High School, to serve out the unexpired term of
Powell J. Grosboll, late County Superintendent of Schools.
Miss Wood has been identified with schoolwork in Petersburg for a number of years. She
started teaching English in the local high school following her graduation from the University of
Illinois, and for several years has been Principal of the school. She is capable, efficient and obliging,
and knows schoolwork from the ground up.
Mrs. Belle Powers, who has served so efficiently for several years as Assistant
Superintendent, will remain in the office in that capacity. The combination of Miss Wood and Mrs.
Powers should prove to be an excellent one, and those in the county who are interested in the schools
are glad that she received the appointment.
It is understood that there were seven applications for the place, and that Miss Wood
received the preference of the Board is an indication that they are thoroughly convinced that she is the
person for the place.&quot;
A Reminiscence of BEULAH MILES WOOD, written by her grandnephew, John Spears
Gidcombe, and contributed by him to the Menard County Tourism Council. It will be used in the
portrayal of Beulah Wood (and other notable Menard County people) for the Menard County Cemetery
Walk, September 17, 2000:
&quot;There are a lot of nice stories to tell about Aunt Beulah. Among them are:
She was a very good storyteller. Because she was so knowledgeable about local history
and especially the early settlers and good citizens of Petersburg and surrounding communities, she was
delighted to be asked to talk. Mom says that as a small girl some of her best recollections were of
evening picnics, perhaps as many as 3 a week. These picnics involved hauling dinner up to the top of
the hill at New Salem to be under the cool trees. Generally it was Mama Wood [Lizzie Miles Wood],
Aunt Beulah, Granny [Florence Wood Spears], Georgey-daddy [George Walter Spears], Mom [Anna
Ney Spears], and the Dr. Newcomers, and the Evans Watkins, or perhaps Uncle George [Spears], and

one or more of the Peterson clan of girls with Ona, and if Mom could wangle it, her Gray cousins
[Miles and Wood] (which is another story). Talk was sophisticated and ranged from politics to religion,
but to Mom the most enchanting feature was when someone would ask Aunt Beulah to tell a story. I
don&#x27;t know what those stories were and I can&#x27;t get them out of Mom, but I suspect they usual tales
about the Miles journey up the river, tales of the Clary&#x27;s Grove boys, and the Lincoln romance were
prominent, because she later told them to me in front of the fire in the house on Moss Ave. As far as
Mom was concerned, fireflies and Aunt Beulah&#x27;s stories were equally wonderful.
She was an excellent teacher. Before her days as principal and Superintendent, she and
another of the teachers were the organizers and directors of the high school plays. They were well
received, and her leading men and women were pointed to with pride on the Saturday night (or was it
Friday night) promenade around the square in Petersburg. Mom remembers being very proud of her
Aunt&#x27;s involvement in the plays and the subsequent recognition when people stopped by their car
parked in front of Finney&#x27;s to congratulate and praise. But even better than that were the playbooks that
lived in the hall tree inside the front door of Mama Wood&#x27;s house. With Aunt Beulah&#x27;s encouragement,
Mom spent hours reading and acting and daydreaming with those plays. Mom has told me that this is
how she learned to speak in public to such good effect.
She went to Columbia University in New York City and got a Masters degree. Can you
imagine her, and her friend and fellow teacher (I can&#x27;t recall at the moment her name) taking rooms
within walking distance (perhaps an apartment or maybe student housing) and actually doing the
degree work. Women were not universally emancipated in small town Illinois but she was.
She bought the first automobile among the Wood family. It was a nice roadster. She
adored her brother [Harlington]. Guess who got to drive it when he needed it on weekends?
She was an accomplished photographer. The pictures that she took now make up the bulk
of the family historical record of her time. The pictures were beautifully composed and they are as
interesting to look at today as then. Mom tells me that this was just taken for granted by the whole
family. Her pictures reveal an artistic side of her personality that was apparently not fully realized.
Finally, for tonight, she was a great eccentric. No, she didn&#x27;t like ice cream but she bought
everyone popcorn at the vendor on the northwest corner of the square. No, she didn&#x27;t give many gifts
but I&#x27;ll never forget the 6 Christmases in a row that I received a bath powder mitt from her. Yes, she
was spoiled by her mother who made a special pan of hot biscuits for her every morning as long as her
mother lived. Yes, she had rages and she held lifetime grudges. But there was a certain gleam in those
watery blue and very crossed eyes of hers that caught my attention. I liked her. I keep a stash of candy
in my dresser drawer too.&quot;</div>
