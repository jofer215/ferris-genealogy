            <div class="person-text">(1.1.1.7.3.4.2.2) ELEANOR LOCKWOOD born July 26, 1891 Litchfield CT and died
November 1978; married June 5, 1918 Joseph Delaney Burge [son of Joseph &amp;
Catherine (Stark) Burge] born October 11, 1890 Louisville KY and died April 19, 1957
Guatemala; (presume this is same guy) a Joseph Delaney Burge, a lumber prospector
from Kentucky, stumbled upon a piece of natural paradise near Atitlan, Guatemala
which has been turned into a coffee finca that was struggling to survive. Burge bought
the finca and offered it to his son, Joseph Jr, to manage. Joe Jr and his Tennessee-born
wife Mary knew nothing of Guatemala or the Spanish language. But they packed their
bags and moved to the Central American wilderness to forge an adverturous life. Joe
died young but his son Andy took his place alongside Mary to steer the business through
the perilous years of revolution from the 1960s until the later ‘90s. Now Andy, his wife
Monica, and the still-feisty Mary are meeting the challenge of surviving the bottoming
coffee market and tailoring Tarrales into a more resilient entity that incorporates a nature
reserve and a blossoming exotic plant nursey; see www.tarrales.com; and born to them
