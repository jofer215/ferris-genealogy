            <div class="person-text">(5.1.2.7.2.2.3.1.2) JUDSON ASPINWALL PARSONS born October 21, 1886 Troy PA; Yale 1909;
from the Yale 5th Year Reunion Book: “The last two years I’ve spent at Harvard Law School and am
now in the office mentioned above (Clerk with Kenefick, Cooke, Mitchell, &amp; Bass, lawyers, Buffalo).
In another year I hope to be admitted to the bar. The first three years out of college I taught school. Life
in general is very much worth while and steadily becoming more so. It seems to me that the ministers
and teachers must have the best time because their workis to watch other people grow and help in the
process. For the ordinary man who goes into something else it’s a bit jolting to have the fact thoroughly
impressed that you are only an ordinary man and maybe you’ve got to hustle to be a good ordinary

man. Every time I go past the news stand down at the Ellicott Square and can afford the luxury, I buy a
New York Evening Post and wonder what you’re doing about it. Buffalo has no few 1909 men that one
more would be necessary to have any kind of a Class reunion. A man at Harvard is more free to follow
his natural bent than a man at Yale. If he is a genius, this is all right, but if he’s a little queer at the
beginning, he’s more queer at the end. Yale demands a certain type, and in producing it, may now and
then stunt the hair of a Paderewski, but it seems to me her great work is to take apparently unpromising
young fellows and in place of their little oddities put some Yale ideals and make them work so hard for
these ideals that the oddities disappear, and after a few years out, the results are successful name men. I
think Yale is doing a bigger work than Harvard.”</div>
