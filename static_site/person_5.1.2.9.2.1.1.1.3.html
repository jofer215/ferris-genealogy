Barger, 76, one of the pioneer automobile mechanics in Peekskill, who worked on and drove the first
automobile in this city, died yesterday at the Colonial Nursing Home, following a long illness. At one
time he was an employee of the late William Lawson when he latter owned and operated a garage on
the north side of Main Street, opposite the Forbush Inn, and on the spot where the Hudson Theatre was
later constructed. He was also employed by John L. Silleck, who operated a garage and repair shop at
the corner of South street; and Union Avenue where the office of Montgomery Ward Co. is now
located. In 1911, he and Charles Yellott built the &quot;Eagel Garage&quot; building on North Division Street,
where the Arrow Motors Inc. is now situated. He and Mr. Yellott continued this business to 1917 when
he retired to accept a position with the Westchester Lighting Company, being in charge their repair
shop in Mount Vernon. The following year, 1918, he returned to Peekskill and went into business for
himself, operating an automobile repair shop until 1929, when he was forced to retire due to ill health.
Later when his health improved he opened a small repair shop in Oregon Corners, which he continued
until 1944, when again he was forced to retire because of his health. He was the owner of many early
automobile tools and equipment and automobile literature. During his life, Mr. Barger did considerable
repair work for the Fire and Highway Departments of the Village of Peekskill. His wife was the late
Gertrude S. Gardiner. Surviving are one son, Clarence G. Barger, 1212 Constant Ave, with whom he
resided for many years, and one daughter, Mrs. Douglas (Ruth) Gale, of Peekskill; four grandchildren
