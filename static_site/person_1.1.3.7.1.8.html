            <div class="person-text">(1.1.3.7.1.8) ROBINSON J WILBER born April 15, 1829 Otsego Co NY and died
March 24, 1897 probably Knox Co IL; 1852-53, 1857-86 Victoria Township, Knox Co
IL; 1853-57 California gold mining; married September 1859 in Knox Co IL, Almina
Lyons [dau of David &amp; Jane (Sornborger) Lyons] born April 21, 1842 Black Rock,
Cayuga, NY and died September 7, 1919; both buried Victoria Cemetery, Victoria IL;
and born to them were (all probably born Knox Co IL):
Of Victoria Township, is one of the leading agriculturists of Knox County, where his farm is located on section 11. He is the
son of Briggs and Rachel (Jones) Wilber, and was born in Otsego County, N.Y. April 15, 1829. His parents were natives of
New York and had a family of 13 children, six of whom are deceased. Those living are Sallie A. who became Mrs.
Sornborger; Eliza, now Mrs. Fairchilds; Ferris, third child; Susan, now Mrs. Hoag; Rachel, who married a Mr. Snyder;
Robinson J. the subject of this sketch, and Deborah A. at present Mrs. Spencer. The father of out subject followed the
calling of a farmer until his demise, in 1831. His widow came west with her daughter, Mrs. Spencer, and located at
Victoria, where her death occurred Dec.6, 1873. R. J. Wilber, of whom we write, remained at home until 21 years of age, in
the meantime assisting in the farm duties and attending school. In 1852 he came to Illinois, making settlement in Victoria
Township, where he engaged with Alexander Sornborger in the stock business. He crossed the plains to California in 1853,
and on October 9 of that year arrived at a place called Hangtown; from there he went to Coloma, and thence to a place
bearing the name of Dry Diggings, where for three years he was engaged in gold mining. In 1857 he returned to Victoria

Township, where he engaged in breaking prairie the first year, and in the year following worked out by the month. For
three years, until 1860, he rented land in Victoria Township, subsequently purchasing his present farm, which contains 80
acres, only half of which at that time was broken. He has improved his farm by erecting a comfortable residence and
convenient and commodious barn. His place is well fenced and beautified by shade and ornamental trees. He has been
extensively engaged in the raising of grain and stock, and is meeting with much success in his chosen vocation. Miss
Almina Lyons, born in Block Rock, N.Y. April 21, 1842, and is the daughter of David and Jane (Sornborger) Lyons, was the
lady chosen by R.J. Wilber to be his companion through life. The marriage ceremony was celebrated Sept 29, 1859. The
parents of Mrs. Wilber came to Illinois in 1844, and located on section7, Victoria Township, at which place the father died
two years later. His widow followed him to the land of the hereafter in 1852. The family of Mr. and Mrs. Lyons numbered
ten children, five of whom are deceased. Those living are Catherine, who became Mrs. Sansbury; David, Edward, Charles
and Almina, wife of our subject. Our subject and wife have become the parents of four children, concerning whom we give
the following: Willis became the husband of Sarah Lafferty, and to them have been born three children—Arthur, Charles,
and Belle. The next in order of birth are Olive, Ferris J. and Earl. Mr. Wilber affiliates with the Greenback party. He has
held the offices of Road Commissioner, School Director and Pathmaster, and is a prominent member of the I.O.O.F. We
have in the life of this gentleman an excellent illustration of how many of the wealthy and influential men of Knox County
began their business careers. Coming here without means, and surrounded by obstacles that would discourage the young
men of today, we find Mr. Wilber has not only accumulated a good property and wielded and influence for the welfare and
good of the community, but has won and retained the respect of all who know him. Source: Portrait &amp; Biographical Album
