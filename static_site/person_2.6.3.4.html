            <div class="person-text">(2.6.3.4) ISAAC QUINTARD - From the record of the General Assembly, March 1775:
It having been represented to this assembly that Isaac Quintard of Stamford, in the County of Fairfield,
Captain of the 2nd military company, in the town of Stamford, in the 9th regt. In this colony, and Fyler
Dibble of said Stamford, Capt. of the first military company of Stamford, in said regiment, at said
Stamford, in January last, in contempt of the authority in this colony, did attempt and endeavor to
prevent the introduction of certain barrels of gun powder into this colony for the government’s use,
agreeably to the orders and directions of legal authority, which conduct is inconsistent with the duty of
their said office and of dangerous tendency; whereupon it is resolved by this assembly, that Gold
Selleck Silliman and Jonathan Sturgiss, Esquires, be and they are hereby appointed Commissioners,
and are fully authorized and empowered to notify said Quintard and Dibble to appear before them at
such time and place as shall be by them appointed and to examine the witnesses relative to said conduct
and examine into the truth of said representations and to report what they shall find to the general
assembly at the session of May next.
No record of the arrest and trial of the captains has been found; but from the American Archives,
Fyler Dibble, September 26, 1775, asked forgiveness of the people for opposing the appointment of a

committee of inspection, and promises to yield hearty obedience to the continental association. Captain
Quintard, also, waived his further opposition and made a humble confession.
The following was furnished by Fred H. Knapp
SERGEANT UZAL KNAPP (2.6.2.3.6) son of Nathaniel and Jemima (Ward) Knapp, the last survivor
of (General/President) George Washington’s Life Guard, born October 22, 1759; baptized October 15,
1786 at Stamford and died January 10, 1856, on his farm at Little Brittain, Orange County NY, and was
buried at Washington’s Headquarters, Newburgh, NY, on January 16, 1856.
Sgt. Knapp joined the Revolutionary Army, at age 16; fought at White Plains, Ridgefield,
Monmouth and Yorktown. In 1780, he became a member of the famous Washington Life Guard and
served as its Sergeant for 2 years with the marked aprobation of General Washington. After leaving
service he spent the remainder of his days in agriculture on a farm in the rich district of Orange County
NY, known as Little Brittain and at the age of 94 sank to his rest, beloved and respected by all who
knew him. His body was taken to Newburgh, on the 14th of January 1856; deposited in the Old
Hasbrouck House, well known as Washington’s Headquarters and on Wednesday, January 16, 1856,
was laid to rest with all the honors of war. Stores and other public buildings were draped in mourning
and thousands went to the old house while the body lay awaiting sepulture to take their last look at the
venerable man who connected in the past age of patriotism and danger with the present glory and
enjoyment. The Reverend John Brown, D.D., Rector of St. George’s Church of Newburgh preached
the funeral sermon and a large number of military companies and civic organizations from Albany,
Newburgh, Montgomery, Port Jervis, and other places, together with corporate authorities of Newburgh
and a vast concourse of citizens attended his remains to the final resting place. It is well to show honor
to such when in life and to mark their departure from earth with circumstances which will embellish
and enrich our nation’s history. [from Frank Leslie’s Illustrated Newspaper of February 2, 1856.]
The last echo in Newburgh of the War of the Revolution was when UZAL KNAPP, was buried at
Washington’s Headquarters. He was the last of Washington’s Body (Life) Guard and died January 1856
at age 95 years. It was the largest funeral in Newburgh’s history and military in character. In the
procession under the direction of (Col.) Parmenter, were the officers of the 19th Regiment; the
Washington Cententals of Albany; the hearse drawn by 4 greys and led by 4 grooms; Washington’s
Continentals of Newburgh, under (Capt.) Kemp; the Orange Co. Hussars; the Montgomery Guards; the
Port Jervis Light Guard; the United Americans, trustees of the village, citizens and strangers in great
numbers.
The funeral service and biographical sketch were by Rev. John Brown, Episcopalian; the
Continentals fired 3 rounds over the grave and Professor Reid’s Choir of St. George sang hymns. The
body had remained in state for several days (2 days) in the centre of the reception room in
Washington’s Headquarters where it was viewed by thousands. On the coffin was the uniform of a
Continental Soldier.
On the day of the funeral, all seemed impressed with the solemnity of the occasion. The village
was robed in sackcloth; the insignia of mourning draped the fronts of businesses and the Stars and
Stripes were furled in the emblem of sorrow.

Old residents of Newburgh have not ceased to regret that the Continentals, a crack independent
military organization, wearing the uniform of the Washington’s Army went out of existence. It is
obvious that the city should have a marching company perpetuating the uniform of the soldiers of the
Revolution. [From Timely Notes - Historical &amp; Otherwise of Newburgh, by J.W.F. Truttenber,
published in the Newburgh Daily, July, 1934.]
In the small volume, by Lossing, entitled: Hours with Living Men and Women of the Revolution:
(1889), is found a chapter entitled ‘The Last Survivor of Washington’s Life Guard’. In this Chapter, is
an interesting interview with Sgt. Uzal Knapp. In reply to Dr. Lossing’s question, “Were you with
Washington all the time he was in New Windsor?”, Uzal’s reply was “Certainly, I was one of the Guard
and I believe I am the only living.” Dr. Lossing then asked: “When did you join the Guard?”, and
Uzal’s reply was “Not long after the Battle of Monmouth.” In Lossing’s Book of the Hudson and from
the book From the Wilderness to the Sea, by Virtus and Larston (1866) - Mr. [Uzal] Knapp, was a
Sergeant of the Guard and was presented a Badge of Military Merit by Washington, the American
Legion of Honor.

Introduction
America&#x27;s Civil War was a highly personal conflict. There were draftees, but the majority of men who fought were
volunteers. In the North they volunteered to fight for the Union, for their country, for their flag. Slavery was, if
anything, a secondary issue, one that would be addressed. and solved at the war&#x27;s end. They fought so that the Mason-Dixon
line would never be a boundary between two foreign countries. They fought and they died. Some died on the battlefield,
some weeks or months later, suffering all that time from appalling wounds. They died of malaria, dysentery, diarrhea,
pneumonia, drowning, measles and typhoid. Union casualties in this worst of all our country&#x27;s wars numbered over six
hundred fifty thousand. Initially, this war was not expected to last more than a few months. By early summer 1862, both
sides began to reassess their positions. Shiloh had cost the Union over 13,000 men, the Seven Days Campaign for
Richmond, another 15,000. Many enlistees had signed up for three, six or nine months. Some were discharged when their
time was up, many just went home when they considered they had served their time. Early in 1862 Lincoln called for
300,000 volunteers, and the response to the initial call was hesitant. In small communities, and Stamford was one of them,
leading citizens offered bonuses to young men willing to enlist. Young women let it be known they would be proud to see
their men in uniform. John Sloan Gibbon wrote, &quot;We are coming, Father Abraham, 300,000 strong&quot; and, in time, they came.
In Stamford, notice was given of a meeting to be held at Seely&#x27;s Hall on Main
Street, Friday evening July 18, 1862, &quot;at seven and half o&#x27;clock, to proffer aid to the government&quot;. A large assembly
gathered, addresses were made and a goodly number of volunteers responded. At a July 24th meeting $2500 was pledged,
later increased to $3000. One hundred nine men enrolled in nine days. Francis R. Leeds held a meeting on the 15th to recruit
a company. By the 29th he had enlisted 110 men, who came to be Company A of the 28th Regiment.
Noah Webster Hoyt, a carpenter and a single man, was 26 when he answered the call and became part of this Company and
part of the last of the nine months&#x27; regiments to be formed in Connecticut. Noah kept a diary. His entries were
accurate, informative, often humorous. Contained in five small notebooks, the simple phrases of his diary tell a story that
reaches across more than a hundred years to touch the heart.
Noah begins, &quot;I, Noah W. Hoyt, enlisted to serve the United States for nine months, and on the 2nd of Sept. we had
a full Comp. Francis R. Leeds was our Capt.&quot; On September 2nd they had their first lesson in military tactics under the
command of Capt. Waterbury, and on the 3rd they left for Camp Terry, in New Haven. &quot;Time jogged along very well again,

and everything was lovely, for we had a plenty to eat and nothing to do but to run up town and see the gals and steal
everything we could lay our hands on, that is in the eating line.&quot; Originally their company had been Co C in the 23rd
Regiment, but when Capt. Leeds did not get the position he sought, he persuaded the Governor to have his company
transferred into the 28th, where they became Co A. The 28th left New Haven on the steamboat &quot;Traveler&quot; on November
17th, having been mustered in for the third time, just before leaving. After an overnight stop at Rikers Island, they arrived at
South Street, Williamsburg, NY in the rain. It rained until the 25th. One day Noah decided he had his fill of rain and the
weather would be better in Stamford, and he left for home, &quot;with a couple of boys who felt the same way&quot; and they stayed
in Stamford until the 28th. That day Noah heard the Constable was around, picking up &quot;skedaddlers&quot;, so he headed for the
depot, where he met said Constable with three or four &quot;skedaddlers&quot; in tow. Noah managed to give the impression that he
was going along with the group, but instead, he slipped away and got back to camp ahead of the others, just in time to hear
&quot;pack knapsacks, strike tents and be ready to march&quot;. And march they did, 12 miles in pouring rain, mud up to their ankles,
and boarded the &quot;Che Kiang&quot; in Brooklyn. With the 23rd regiment also on board, there were 1400 men where 800 might
have been comfortable. December 5th they encountered a gale at sea, so severe they all thought they were doomed,
especially when the Captain ordered life boats lowered and provisioned. After losing the yardarms and having the deck
sprung from the hull, they rode out the storm. The next night the Assistant Engineer fell asleep and the red hot boilers were
discovered just in time to avert an explosion. To compound their discomfort on the trip, most of the 1400 men were
desperately seasick. Noah doesn&#x27;t mention that he suffered with this problem. On December 11th they anchored at Ship&#x27;s
Island on the Mississippi and here they stayed until the 17th. Noah mentions the warm days, cool nights and swimming in
water about the same temperature as Stamford&#x27;s in September. Ship&#x27;s Island had been a military part of the expedition for
the capture of New Orleans, under General Butler. About 1200 men of the 23rd and 28th Regiments were there until the
18th, on half rations all that time. The 28th boarded the &quot;Che Kiang&quot; once again on December 17th, with five companies of
the 23rd, and they arrived at New Orleans at 5 p.m. on the 19th. On the 20th they went up river to Carrollton and then to
Camp Parrish, nine miles above New Orleans. Here they pitched tents and prepared to settle in when they were ordered
back aboard the boat until morning. Then, back to New Orleans where they loaded coal and left for Pensacola, where they
arrived on the 22nd.
Noah became ill with dysentery at this time. At Pensacola he was quartered in the Methodist Church until December 24th.
The city had been vacated on May 9th of 1861, and the soldiers were moved into private homes. Officers were quartered in
fully furnished homes, and Noah noticed the good mahogany furniture and &quot;pianofortes&quot;. He commented often on furniture
and gives dimensions of rooms, as might be expected of a carpenter and builder, and son of a cabinetmaker. Noah was
quartered in a house which had been fitted for the 91st New York. Ten or twelve men were assigned to a room where they
had 10 foot ceilings and a fireplace. Here Noah spent Christmas and New Year&#x27;s. The men complained of bad food and were
suspicious that the lieutenants were drawing more than their share of food and selling it. Finally, they forced the officers to
give over distribution of the food to a sergeant, and here Noah names the Stamford lieutenant who was decided upon as the
guilty party. Noah recovered from his dysentery by the 4th, but rations must still have been slim, for on January 15th he
writes, &quot;Shot a wild hog, bayoneted him, tied his legs together, carried him 3 miles to camp arriving at 8 p.m. Built a fire in
the fireplace, skinned the hog and roasted it.&quot; On the 19th, Col. Dyer of the 15th Maine, with 60 Maine and Connecticut
men, scouted for cattle. Those on horseback gathered about 15 head together and started them for camp. &quot;Some of them was
so thin and lank you could see daylight through them.&quot; The poor quality hogs were kept for meat. &quot;It would take three of the
largest to make a shadow&quot;. Noah had poor opinions of the success of their cattle-rustling. Capt. Leeds had been suffering
from typhoid fever when his regiment left Stamford in September, and he rejoined them February 1st. On the 8th he
returned to the hospital with dysentery and died February 17th. Noah reports, &quot;The body was boxed for shipment and on the
18th, to muffled drums, placed on a steamer to Fort Pickens. There they obtained a cask and 35 gallons of whiskey into
which we put his body.&quot; The steamer took off without the cask, which was finally shipped on the 25th. &quot;And this is the last
of Captain Francis R. Leeds.&quot; Captain Leeds was finally buried in Woodland Cemetery.
John E. Hoyt died, also of dysentery, on February 21st. He was buried in a pine box in the cemetery at Pensacola,
with a 24 gun salute, and Noah commented, &quot;Such a death I hope never to see again.&quot; On the 24th they began having
trouble with guerrillas, who would drive Union pickets into camp and then retreat. Several times they tried to track the Rebs
without success, only to be fired upon as they returned to camp. Finally, on March 6th, men of the Connecticut and Maine
regiments under Colonel Ferris, boarded 7 small sail boats. They were joined by 10 marines, 18 sailors and one field piece.
One hundred men decamped at Judson&#x27;s Mill, marched two hours in the rain, and searched houses. Finding one with a spark
in the fireplace and food on the table, they began to break in a locked door behind which they found 3 Negroes. They

learned that 36 cavalrymen came to that house every day to feed men and horses. The Yanks divided into three companies
and Noah was among those assigned to the old house, with 12 or 15 others. When the Rebs rode up next morning, 2 or 3
sailors, without orders, opened fire. The result was that only 4 were captured. After destroying all buildings and supplies,
the men boarded their sailboats again. The 7th boat had run aground and the boat engaged in rescue, capsized. Eight Maine
men and two sailors were lost. Bodies were retrieved and buried in the cemetery at Pensacola.
Noah described Pensacola in favorable terms, as having a good harbor with a railroad to the dock. In peacetime
there was manufacturing of turpentine, pitch, tar, etc. and cotton shipping. The 28th left Pensacola for Barrancas on March
20th, but Noah remained behind on picket duty until the 22nd. Upon arriving at Barrancas, he found his regiment in tents in
the woods, 1/4 mile from the west shore of Pensacola Bay and 1/4 mile north of Fort Barrancas. While there, and on a
scouting expedition to Perdita Point, 25 men left camp and returned on March 27th with 6 prisoners and 12 guns. A man
from Greenwich, Cpl Isaac Moore, was lost on this trip. On the 29th, Noah
was called to the hospital to help lay out William Totton who died of typhoid and brain fever. Several days were spent
settling into camp and Noah complained constantly of dust and sand. He was reminded of the biblical quote, &quot;Of dust thou
are and to dust thou shalt return&quot;. He thought they were returning to dust. He remarks on April 13th that they &quot;buried a
Milford man, caused by the doctor giving him the wrong medicine&quot;. This was a man from New Milford, Decatur D. Mersh.
Noah was not impressed with the quality of medical care.
On May 2nd the paymaster appeared, and the men were paid from enlistment date to March 1st. On May 6th a
Winsted man, Myron N. Hubbard, died. At this point Noah reports they had fired on a provision boat and returned to the
scene to find provisions stashed on shore. He notes that the blank books being used as his diaries were part of this supply.
May 10th they embarked on the transport &quot;Crescent City&quot; and en route to Brashear City, they ran aground twice in
soft mud. At Brashear City where they arrived on May 12th, they encamped on a sugar cane plantation with about 5000
troops. Here General Banks captured large quantities of supplies, including cattle, horses, mules, 2 tugs, artillery pieces and
shot guns.
On May 22nd they buried the drummer of Co D, Aaron N. Ford of New Milford and on the 23rd, orders were
received to leave for Algiers. &quot;Buried two men, one from Co D (Henry Dailey of Sherman) and one from Co F (Caissus
Watson of Winchester) and left 15 in hospital including William Taylor, Lewis Provost and Spencer Bouton&quot;. Bouton died
June 7th. Noah was careful always to mention by name the Stamford men who died.
May 24th they boarded the steamer, &quot;George Cromwell&quot;. Noah stayed on deck. The boat was loaded with cotton
and it rained all the way to Springfield Landing, 10 miles above Baton Rouge. Here there was nothing but a tent hospital,
and on the 25th, they marched 15 miles toward Port Hudson and stayed the night. Next day they marched another 20 miles
to join Grovers Division, one half mile from the rebel batteries at Port Hudson. Here their rest was constantly interrupted by
pickets firing. They then marched 5 miles further, toward the rebels, battery and cavalry in advance, and dispersed the
rebels. Their regiment and others had marched 25 miles, been fed 1/2 pound of salt pork and 1 pound of hard tack from May
23rd to the morning of the 27th.
On the 27th they &quot;fed well on sheep, goats, hogs and cattle&quot;, and a bloody battle ensued, including a bayonet
charge which captured 4 guns. The Union lost about 800 men. The Negro regiment involved, &quot;Stood up like heroes and lost
about 400 killed or wounded.&quot;
May 28th Noah described the wounded in graphic terms and with great sympathy. It might be well to note that had
the 28th been mustered out when their nine months was actually over, they would have been home by this time.
On the 30th of May, he comments, &quot;Heavy cannonading still going on. Rebel guns mostly silenced. Our men lay so
close under their batteries that the instant they attempted to load a gun or show themselves upon the breastworks, they were
shot down.&quot;
May 1st - &quot;Still at the old sugar mill, hot days, dirt floors to sleep on with wood ticks and fleas. There we sit,
broiling in the sun all day and sleeping on the baked earth at night, with nothing for shelter except the heavens. But of this
we do not complain, for it is nothing compared with the pain and suffering we have endured from wood ticks and fleas.&quot;
&quot;Rebels attempted to escape by a charge through our lines. They were warmly received and politely invited back by a heavy
charge of musketry and artillery.&quot;
At about 6 a.m. on June 3rd, the 28th left the old sugar mill for the battle field. On June 4th Noah says, &quot;When we
marched into the entrenchments, I thought our time had come, for they opened up on us with shell. None injured. For 15-20
minutes we lay, hugging the ground as our last phantom of hope, expecting every minute to be our last on earth. Shells were
bursting above us and all around us and had it not been for the gun boats opening on them as they did, I think we would

have suffered badly, for every shell burst nearer and nearer to us. We were in a ticklish position. I am sorry to say that the
28th Regt disgraced themselves that night, for as soon as they began to shell, the Regt began to
scatter. About 2 companies marched in the entrenchments (Co A and F). The rest scattered, there could not be more than half
of each company around. Co B lost the right to carry the colors, which was given to Co A. Co B also lost position as the 4th
Co in the Regt and placed in 6th place.&quot;
June 6th was a quiet day and Noah used the time to describe their location. Port Hudson is situated on the
Mississippi, south of Vicksburg, on a high bluff. Sheer cliffs descend to water&#x27;s edge. The fortifications were 6 miles in
length, the principal part a natural fortification, and surrounded by deep ravines, 10 to 60 feet deep in places, and a dense
forest. The railroad from Mobile into Port Hudson had been entirely destroyed by the Union and the location was
completely surrounded by Union infantry and artillery.
About 7 p.m. on June 7th, the Rebels opened fire. About 10 a.m. that day they had offered a flag of truce to let the
Union withdraw. Noah says, &quot;Our water is very poor. Nothing but the draining of the ground and runs along through the
ravines. It is about the color of the ground and we have to wash and drink out of the same stream.&quot;
On the 8th, the 28th and others dug rifle pits. On the 9th there was heavy firing on the Rebs all day. Buildings and tents
within the fortifications were seen to be in flames. Little return fire was experienced.
June 11th - 28th was still in the entrenchments and it was HOT. On the 12th they came out in darkness and slept.
On the 13th they opened fire on the Rebels and in about one hour the Rebs sent in a flag of truce. No indication of any
resultant action. On the 12th, orders were received for a storming party, which was scheduled for the 14th, and on the 14th
the battle was raging before sunrise. This is the charge the history books call the &quot;forlorn hope&quot;, for there
was no way the Union forces could take Port Hudson by storming party. In this encounter, grenades were issued to the 28th,
who had never seen them before. The instructions were hasty and it was perhaps fortunate they were never in position for
grenade use. This was also the day Sgt Stiles Raymond volunteered to take the place of Sgt George Mead since Mead had a
wife and little daughter at home, and Raymond was single. At daylight they began the charge. In the fierce battle they drove
the Confederates a half mile deeper into their fortifications. The Union got a number of cannons nearer to the main works
and were ordered to make a bayonet charge on the Rebel batteries. Two charges were made, and men were cut down &quot;Like
grass before the scythe&quot;, Noah says. &quot;Our brigade was ordered to charge. Two regiments were in front, the 9th
Massachusetts and the 173rd New York. The 9th refused to charge. No one blamed them.&quot; The 173rd was then ordered to
charge upon the 9th and drive them over the breastworks. They, too, refused. &quot;We were then ordered up and when within 25
rods of their breastworks, were cut off by musketry. Could not go further, nor could we retreat, for everything was in such
confusion. We had to throw ourselves on the ground and crawl behind logs and brick to secrete ourselves. There we lay, all
day in the broiling sun and dust 3&quot; deep, and had to take their raking fire all day. Dreadful was our suffering that day, not
only from bullets, but from heat and thirst. The loss that day was about 1000 killed, wounded and missing, the loss in the
28th was 75 to 100. One regiment shot its own officers who were trying to make them charge the batteries. &quot; Here Noah
reports General Banks&#x27; promise to &quot;bombard and bury Port Hudson in
iron, but instead he buried the men.&quot; On June 15th scattered companies began to come together. Cpl James Vaile and Pvt
Jayson Wardwell were killed. Lt. Duran and Sgt George Waterbury were also dead. Charles Roseborough was wounded in
the breast by buck shot. They were in the rifle pits and under fire until the 18th. On the afternoon of the 17th, George
Wilmot started for water and was shot dead. On June 20th, Hoyt started with brigades of infantry to roust an enemy camp.
Noah had been ill and had to fall out after a mile and a half. He got back to camp where he was ill for 3 or 4 days. He had to
pretend to take Doc Lyons&#x27; pills or do duty before he was able. &quot;I planted them in the ground to see if they would not grow
in case the old Doctor should get out of them. If I had put all they gave me down my throat, they would have planted me&quot;.
Hoyt had little faith in the doctor&#x27;s camphor and opium pills and when on June 24th, George Cook died, it is duly noted that
he had been given the pills. On July 1st Noah reported they were not in Port Hudson yet, and on July 4th, &quot;Port Hudson
must fall soon, Rebs are deserting, coming to camp in groups of 5,
10, 20 and 50.&quot; On the 6th, while still in the rifle pits, Hoyt was suffering with jaundice. On the 7th they heard the news of
the surrender of Vicksburg. They called the news to the Rebs who raised a flag of truce and on the 8th, all firing ceased.
General Gardner (CSA) sent word to General Banks that if Banks would show official reports of the surrender of Vicksburg,
Gardner would surrender Port Hudson. July 9th, &quot;Our forces marched into Port Hudson and at 10 a.m. the Stars and Stripes
were raised.&quot; A salute of 24 guns was sounded at the flag raising. &quot;How much different the booming of those same guns
sounded in our ears on that day from what it did on the 14th of June. A day long to be remembered, especially by the 28th
Ct for our loss on that day was more than any one Regiment in the Division. Three hundred twenty five men marched for

the field. We lost one-quarter.&quot; July 15th, &quot;Our term of service should have been complete.&quot; Very hot, longing to &quot;once more
poke my head into an old oaken bucket that hangs in a northern well.&quot;
July 25th, &quot;Still sweltering. Four of our company have died in the last 25 days, 10 more reported on the sick list, 5
of them in the hospital.&quot;
July 28th, Cpt G.W. Platt was buried, dysentery since June 15. On the 30th they buried Nathan Sherwood, 27
years old, fever, ill three weeks. Twelve men dead from Co A. &quot;Would to God the bones of those that the means of keeping
us here could be bleached out beneath this scorching sun, for we have done our duty and our term of service is justly out and
we ought to have been to our respective homes long ere this.&quot; The Regiment had averaged a loss of four men a week for the
last two months. Col. Ferris had gone home from Port Hudson and &quot;left his Regt here to die in the woods. Gen. Banks, I
believe, has also gone home.&quot; Noah was bitter about their being left to the care of indifferent officers of other outfits. They
moved into Port Hudson and on August 3rd Andrew Waterbury died of measles. Next day his brother, Steven, also died of
measles, contracted while caring for Andrew. That day they broke camp and arrived at an open field within Port Hudson
where there was good spring water. Doctor Lyons died on the 6th, he had been ill for 4 weeks. That evening they boarded
the steamer &quot;Madison&quot; to start the long journey home, buried a member of Co D en route to the boat.
On August 9th they went ashore to bury a man from Co D at 4 a.m. and arrived at Vicksburg at 4:30. Lt Hugerford
of Co D also died and was buried in Vicksburg. So was Bissell, the Hosp. Steward of Co D.
On the 10th they started upriver again, and at sundown went ashore to bury Andrew Hoyt. At New Orleans they
left Henry Lower in a hospital. He was never heard of again. All along the river Noah reports that it is very hot and the
mosquitoes are fearful.
On the 13th they arrived at Memphis, having been five days on the boat with coffee, moldy hard tack and stinking
meat. In Memphis they buried a man from Co H, Hibbert Mead from Greenwich and left 25 or 30 men in the hospital,
including J. Lockwood, D. Lockwood, Aaron Billings and Theodore Knapp. There they also filled the knapsacks which had
just been returned to them, with bread, cakes, pies and ate apples, peaches and pies. En route once more with minor
problems of being stuck in the mud, they stopped on the 14th to bury a man from Co. F. On the 15th they reached Cairo,
Illinois and left George R. Searles in the hospital, with 10 or 12 others. On the afternoon of the 16th, they left the steamer
and transferred to &quot;cars&quot;. When they reached Matoon, Illinois, they were &quot;Kindly treated by citizens with coffee, bread and
cakes.&quot; Then back on the railroad, traveling through Illinois to Indianapolis where the citizens once more turned out with
good food. Along the way the cars also improved, to where they were traveling on upholstered seats and appreciating that
comfort. On the 18th in Cleveland the tables were loaded with the &quot;best of everything&quot; and there they left John Lowr,
Charles J. Brown, Henry M. Whitney, Alonzo Morgan, Asable and Gilbert Scofield. Noah reports the trip home in great
detail and ultimately reports that the regiment was dismissed August 30th &quot;and the worn out men steered for their respective
homes once more&quot;. On September 1st they were paid off in full and he says, &quot;There ends a nine months job, thank God, for
many a poor and worn out man, who was compelled to serve over one year to accomplish that nine months. Served nine
months and one day.&quot; With his final comment on their length of service, the diaries end. There is more to the story. Noah
made no report on their arrival in Stamford, but Loomis Scofield of New Canaan, reported the scene.
The train arrived at Stamford depot, where a large reception party had gathered, complete with band, flags flying,
cannon salutes, ready for the parade and the reception to follow. Then the men began to disembark and Loomis says, &quot;We
were considered the hardest looking regiment that ever came into Connecticut, as we had been two months without a change
of clothing, covered with vermin, beards grown, our hair long.&quot; Parents failed to recognize their sons. Men too sick to stand
were carried from the train on litters. Loomis speaks of Andrew and Stephen Waterbury, &quot;Their mother met our companies
(Co A and B) when we arrived at the Stamford railroad station on our return from the war, expecting to see her boys. We had
to tell her the sad news that they had passed away before we left Port Hudson. She was a widow and it was certainly very
sad for her.&quot; George Mead, whose life was spared in the &quot;forlorn hope&quot;, came home and died the first week in September of
a malignant fever. His little daughter shortly thereafter. There were several instances of men from this regiment dying soon
after returning home, and in two more cases a little daughter also died. One man was &quot;deranged&quot; and died in a Boston
hospital. Another believed for the rest of his life that he had to defend his home against the Rebels and paced his sentry post
every day, relieved by his dog, whom he believed to be his sentry relief. Two of the Lockwoods died of fever. The
Lockwoods lost a third son in another regiment. All three of the Scofields, their near neighbors, came home safety. One
hundred seventy seven Stamford men enlisted in the 28th regiment. Thirty-seven died. These were more than statistics.
These men lived in a small community, Stamford was then a town of fewer than 10,000 persons. They were boys together,
went to school together, danced with the same girls, married each other&#x27;s sister, worked side by side. Their regiment is

credited with only one engagement in the Connecticut Adjutant General&#x27;s history, but that engagement helped to gain
control of the Mississippi for the Union. Loss of that control doomed the Confederacy. They were cut off from ports on the
Gulf, cut off as well from western supplies of men and food.
Noah Hoyt came home without suffering any serious health problems. He took up his trade as a joiner, married and
had a son. He built a handsome home on what is now Washington Boulevard. His brothers, Henry and John also fought for
the Union. Henry served with the 6th Ct and died at Pocataligo, SC in October of 1862. John came home after fighting with
Grant at Petersburg and apparently worked with Noah and their father.
Noah&#x27;s last entry in his diary reflects the bitterness he felt with the system. The men of his regiment were mustered
in three times, the last muster on November 5th. They had enlisted on the 2nd of September for nine months. Had they been
discharged at the end of nine months, they would not have been in the rifle pits at Port Hudson.
Bitter or not, Noah took up his life and went on with it. And every time the 28th had a reunion, Noah was there at the
&quot;campfire&quot; where old comrades met for dinner, songs, speeches and reminiscences. At the reunion on June 15, 1903 he
read from his diaries. He is buried in Woodland Cemetery in a section reserved to be dedicated to Civil War veterans. The
idea never made it to fruition. Even the path to that area has been grassed over. Stamford never erected the planned
Civil War monument, either. A handsome Rogers group was designed by the Norwalk sculptor. The city failed to raise the
necessary funds, and Rogers smashed the model. For some years, a cannon and a heap of cannon balls occupied a plinth in
what is now Columbus Park. In World War 11 these were contributed to the war effort.
When Battle Flag Day was held in Hartford September 17, 1879, the anniversary of the Battle of Antietam, while
10,000 spectators looked on, the colors of the 28th were paraded with the rest and placed in the Hall of Flags in the Capitol
Building.
Sherwood says in his Story of Stamford, &quot;The little state of Connecticut sent into the Union armies more men in
proportion to its population than any other Northern state, and also finished great quantities of supplies.&quot; He also says,
&quot;Between 750 and 800 Stamford men served, more than 10% of the population. No other town in the state furnished a larger
percentage of its inhabitants.&quot;
