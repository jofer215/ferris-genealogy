History of Isabella County, Michigan, 1884, page 472:
Albert A. Shaver, dealer in furniture, undertaker, and Treasurer of Clare County, resides at Clare, near the Isabella County
line. He was born in Steuben Co., N. Y., Sept. 17, 1840, the son of Lewis and Sarah (Chapman) Shaver, natives of New
England and of English-German descent. The father died in Gratiot County, this State, in 1879; the mother resides with Mr.
Shaver at Clare. The subject of this sketch came with his parents to Emerson Township, Gratiot Co., Mich., in 1856, and
lived there until Sept. 13, 1862. On that date he enlisted in Co. D, 26th Mich. Vol. Inf., and his command was assigned to
the Army of the Potomac, under Gen. Hancock. On the last day&#x27;s fight in the Wilderness he was wounded in the left hip by a
minie-ball. He also fought at Petersburg and on the South-Side Railroad, of Virginia, where he was again wounded, a bullet
passing through the liver and kidney. At the time he received this second wound he was color-bearer of his regiment. From
these two injuries he was in hospital 13 months. He was discharged July 24, 1865, after an honorable service of about three
years. Returning to Gratiot County, he lived at home two years, during which time he was married to Ellen Muscott, a native
of Gratiot County, where she was born April 9, 1849. After marriage, he resided on a farm in Gratiot County until 1871,
when he came to Clare. Here he worked at carpentry, which trade he had learned after leaving the army. He built the first
house in Clare, camping out under a large elm tree while at work on the same. In August, 1879, he entered upon his present
business with a stock of $1,200, which is now increased to $3,000. He does an annual business of $6,000. Mr. S. is Trustee
of the Congregational Church, of which he and wife are active members. He has been School Assessor, and for six years
Treasurer. In 1879 he was Supervisor, and the following year he was elected County Treasurer, which office he now holds.
In politics, he is a staunch Republican.</div>
