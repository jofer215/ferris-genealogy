William L. Clements Library, The University of Michigan, Helen Maria Noye Hoyt Papers
Helen or Nellie M. Noye was born December 26, 1839 in Rye, New York, but her family lived in Buffalo, N.Y., where her
father, John T. Noye, was a clerk. The family stayed in Buffalo, where John Noye later became a wealthy manufacturer of
mill machinery. Helen had two brothers Hadie and Richard K., and a sister Lizzie. In August of 1863 Helen journeyed to
Annapolis, Maryland, to spend one year as a volunteer nurse in the U.S. General Hospital Division No. 1, also called the
Naval Academy Hospital. The hospital had opened in 1857 and remained open through out the Civil War, even though the
Naval Academy itself had been removed to Newport, Rhode Island. Helen was the youngest of 10 nurses at the hospital, so
young that when Dorothea Dix, chief of the army nurses, visited the camp, Helen was &quot;spirited away&quot; in fear that she would
be ordered to leave because of her age. Helen worked under the supervision of nurse Sister Tyler, and the surgeon in charge
Dr. B. A. Vanderkeift. She roomed and worked with Maria or Hallie Hall, who was 27 and, of all the nurses, closest in age
to Helen. Helen and Miss Hall became &quot;best and life long friends,&quot; both of them being very religious and more critical of
the other nurses for their exaggerations and drama.
Helen&#x27;s work was mainly to tend to the wounded soldiers. She distributed food to the soldiers, wrote letters they dictated,
and she wrote letters to the soldiers&#x27; families after their deaths. Her deep religious sentiments lead her to read sermons to the
soldiers, comfort them spiritually, and in some cases convert them. When she started working, most of her patients were
paroled prisoners from Richmond, Va. Later patients came from those wounded at the battles around Petersburg, and
eventually only wounded officers were assigned to the hospital. Helen showed kindness to all the soldiers who came
through the hospital, including black soldiers who were segregated, and a young Confederate soldier, who died at the
hospital. In early March of 1864, while Miss Hall was away, Helen was given extra duties and placed in charge of section
five. In addition to tending more soldiers, she was in charge of arranging their meals. Helen very much enjoyed preparing
the soldiers&#x27; food, even if she did feel &quot;how hard a lady&#x27;s position as supervisor is.&quot;
In July 1864, due to the proximity of the Confederate Army, Helen and the other nurses were ordered to leave the hospital.
After departing the hospital, the train on which Helen was riding was captured by the Confederate Army just north of
Baltimore. Helen and the other passengers were helped off the train and left with their baggage and a handcar. The next day
the abandoned passengers were picked up by a steamer and Helen returned to Buffalo to care for her ailing mother. Helen
never returned to the hospital and the work to which she was &quot;heart and soul devoted.&quot; In 1867 Helen married Birney Hoyt
(1841-1900) in Buffalo, N.Y., and the couple moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan. Birney Hoyt was a lawyer, and from 18711881 a circuit court judge. According to the 1880 census, they had four sons, John, Richard, Hobert, and Haward. A fifth
son, Arthur Birney was born in 1880. They also had two female servants. Helen Noye Hoyt outlived her husband by 26
years. She died February 7, 1926.</div>
