            <div class="person-text">(4.4.5.1.3.8) MUNSON INGERSOLL LOCKWOOD (#1548) born July 11, 1810 Greenwich
(Stanwich) (Ossining NY) and died February 20, 1875 Ossining NY; followed the example of his older
brothers, and entered the profession of law, but his fondness for a political career prevented him from
attaining the same eminence as they. From his earliest manhood, he was a student of military tactics,
and an ardent lover of the military profession. He was successively Captain, Colonel, and General in
the State Militia. One of the finest military companies of the State bore his name, The Lockwood Light
Guard of Ossining. General Lockwood gave the labor of his best years to improve the militia of the
counties representing the Seventh Brigade, of which he was commandant. He numbered among his
friends, Governors Seward and Seymore, who frequently visited his military encampments. He

same township. Like his older brothers, he was an intimate friend of Henry Clay; married 1st August 1,
1838 in NY, Sarah Lewis Smith [dau of Caleb &amp; Rachel Roome (Wells) Smith] born January 16, 1817
NY; married 2d April 13, 1864 in Tarrytown NY, Amelia Jane Havell [dau of Robert &amp; Amelia Jane
(Edington) Havell]. Born to Munson and Sarah were:</div>
