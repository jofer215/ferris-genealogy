            <div class="person-text">(3.4.5.1.3.1.1.1.1.2.2) NATHAN CABOT HALE, JR., Ph.D, N.A., FNSS (Photo) from www.agesofman.org “My name is Nathan Cabot Hale. I born July 5th, 1925 at Los Angeles,
California. I have been told that at my birth my family was worth about five million dollars in various
properties, such as oil, mining, real estate, and a ten thousand acre ranch. But all this was lost in stock
market crash of 1929. Neverthe less, I was fortunate to grow up with marvelous parents, an interesting
assortment of aunts and uncles, and two sets of remarkable grandparents. My heritage from my fathers
side were stirring tales of adverturous forebears..and a house full of fascinating paintings and sculpture
that had somehow survived the crash. From my mothers side was a devoted grandmother who knew art
and literature..and a grandfather who was a master-builder of pipe organs. He could play many
instruments, and as a six year old I can recall him playing Bach from memory in his vast and empty

organ factory. These things made me aware that true wealth comes from human ability and character.
When I was seven, circumstances put me into an orphan’s home where I remained for two years. In that
place I was subjected to the most brutal treatment imaginable (believe this), but I survived with my
essential spirit unbroken. So I entered into the world with great questions about human behavior and
human destiny. The forces of art within me saved my life.” See Internet for other info. He married
