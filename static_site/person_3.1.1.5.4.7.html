            <div class="person-text">(3.1.1.5.4.7) DEBORAH DREW born May 18, 1781 Kent NY and died there August 4, 1834 (1839) [if
either of these death dates are correct, then we have a problem with children below born after her
death]; married in December 1800 [first child born in 1828 – sounds suspicious], as his 2d wife, John
Hazen [son of John and Deborah (Drew) Hazen] [another source has his parents as Caleb &amp; Sarah
(Hamline) Hazen] born July 17, 1773 Hazen Hill, Carmel NY and died there (or Kent NY) February
11, 1823 [same thing, if this death date is correct, then we have a problem with all the children below
born after his death date]; another marriage is listed to Robert Boyd. John was associated with his
brother Joshua in the iron business; and they also cut wood and burned charcoal; he was supervisor for
Kent, also Justice of the Peace; and just before his death was elected County Judge. He was appointed
Ensign of Captain Kniffen’s Company, Light Infantry, Dutchess County Militia June 7, 1793 and
Lieutenant of Captain Rowland’s Company 1797. Born to her and John were [I feel these kids are the
wrong ones for this couple]:

(3.1.1.5.4.7.1) MARY HAZEN born October 26, 1828 and died July 16, 1853; buried Penn Yan NY; at
the time of her death, she was engaged to marry Rev. C. C. Norton, who later married a sister of George
Z. Noble, and who was for many years and until the time of his death, pastor of the Central Park
Baptist Church on East 83d Street, New York City</div>
