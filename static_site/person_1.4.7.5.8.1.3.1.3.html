            <div class="person-text">(1.4.7.5.8.1.3.1.3) NOEL ANNE FERRIS (Photo) born December 24, 1950 Easton CT.;
B.A. George. Middlebury College 1973; J.D. Cardozo School of Law, Yeshiva U., 1980
Immigration Judge Noel Anne Ferris ’80 won’t ever forget the man from Albania who recently appeared in her small
courtroom to seek asylum in the United States. He was about the same age as the judge, 50, but he looked like he was in his
late 70s. However, his deteriorating physical condition was not caused by political persecution. Instead, it stemmed from
working for decades as a coal miner in a poor country. That did not meet any of the narrow grounds Congress has approved
for political asylum. Humanitarian concerns are not enough to admit all foreign nationals who seek refuge in the United
States. “I could not find a way of granting that case,” Ferris said of the Albanian. Ferris has worked as a judge in

Manhattan’s Immigration Court for seven years. The court is part of the United States Justice Department, but it is
independent of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Ferris and her colleagues interpret a body of law that is “one
step worse” than the infamously complex Internal Revenue Code. Two other Cardozo graduates also work as immigration
judges in Manhattan: Sarah Burr ’80 and Matthew Adrian ’87. “This is a real court,” says Ferris, who wears a black robe
when she is sitting. Judges are presiding “almost all the time,” so there is little time for research or reflection. They ask
questions and are expected to make oral rulings. However, there is no clerk and no stenographer. The proceedings are
recorded on a tape recorder operated by the judge. At the hearings, “everybody has a different story to tell.” This variety
helps keep the work “fresh and interesting;” Ferris expects to spend the rest of her career on the court. The stories also have
given her a unique perspective on current international affairs. The testimony has convinced her that “it is shocking and
immoral” to ignore human rights abuses around the world. “We have a responsibility to prevent people from murdering each
other.” Ferris was one of many students at Cardozo seeking a second career. She had worked as an assistant to the fashion
director of B. Altman for four years after graduating from college. She enrolled in law school because she wanted to work as
the administrator of a charity and was tired of being asked how fast she typed. At first, she was a little scared, but was
stimulated and challenged by “an incredible faculty” of professors like Telford Taylor, Stewart Sterk, and Peter Lushing.
Within two weeks, Ferris discovered that she loved litigation. The Law School did not teach Immigration Law when Ferris
was a student. She took up the field later because she wanted to work for the United States Attorney’s Office, and that’s
where the opening was. After leaving the office, she practiced immigration law at a private firm before being appointed an
immigration judge. Last year, a California newspaper rated Ferris the eighth toughest of more than 200 immigration judges
in granting asylum requests. Ferris says that such comparisons ignore differences among immigration courts. The
Manhattan branch is the busiest in the nation, draws petitioners from an unusually large number of countries, and has a large
asylum caseload. It calls on interpreters who speak more than 60 languages. In a given week, Ferris may hear cases from
nine or more countries. Chinese and Albanians are the most common petitioners, but on a single day recently, Ferris heard
cases involving nationals of both Outer and Inner Mongolia. Attempts at fraud are common, and Ferris works hard to detect
it. “I take my oath of office very seriously,” she says. However, she cannot blame people who have had “awful lives” and
try to get into the United States. “There’s nothing so wonderful as being able to tell people they can stay here for the rest of
their lives, especially when terrible things have happened to them in their home countries.”</div>
