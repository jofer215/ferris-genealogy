            <div class="person-text">(3.3.2.6.3.1.1) MARY A. FERRIS (Mary Augustus Ferris) born March 4, 1839; schoolteacher;
married, as his 2d wife, Rev. Joseph Judah Woolley [son of Joseph &amp; Fannie (Burroughs) Woolley]
born September 17, 1832 Bridgeport CT, a Methodist minister; He studied for the ministry in the M. E.
Church, and joined the New York East Conference in 1856, and was stationed at South Norwalk, Conn.
When the war broke out in 1861, he was commissioned as chaplain in the 8th Regiment, Conn.
Volunteers, and was connected with the Burnside expedition into North Carolina, being actively

attack of typhoid fever, and he came home in the spring of 1862. Immediately after his recovery he presented the cause of the Chaplain&#x27;s aid Commission in this State; and it was while engaged in this work,
that he was invited to become the Pastor of the Center Congregational Church in Meriden, Conn.,

first wife was the daughter of Charles Briscoe of Bridgeport, Conn., with whom he lived five years;
during four years of which she was an invalid, being confined to her room the greater part of the time.
She died May 6th, 1860, leaving no children. In Dec. 1861 he married the daughter of Deacon Stephen

the daughter was:</div>
