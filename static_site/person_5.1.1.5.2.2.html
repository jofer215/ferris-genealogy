            <div class="person-text">(5.1.1.5.2.2) WILLIAM JAMES HAYES born November 9, 1795 Galway NY and died November 1,
1849 Sparta, Randolph, IL; July 1833 William and his family left their home in Galway and traveled to
Cleveland OH to look over land and visit with Anna’s half-sister, Ursula Cownover Talor. In July,
William left Cleveland and went to Illinois to see if he liked it better than Ohio. Apparently, he liked
what he saw because in September 1833, he and his family moved to Fort Clark (now Peoria) IL. After
his arrival in Illinois, William bought and sold a great deal of land in the area. In 1834, they moved to
Randolph County. In 1837 William made a trip back to New York and on his way back to Illinois, he
contacted small pox. Three of his children subsequently caught the disease, but all recovered. In 1841,
William had a public sale, selling his farm and personal property consisting of: 4 horses, 40 head of
cattle, 50 hogs, one 2-horse wagon, harnesses, ploughs, cradles, hay, grain, etc. In 1842, William was
involved in the underground railroad. He helped five &quot;indentured servants&quot; (Susan Richardson &quot;Sukey&quot;,
Hannah Morrison, and Susan&#x27;s children, Jarrot, Harrison, and Anderson) escape from Randolph County
IL. The five had belonged to Andrew Borders, a very wealthy and influential man who lived west of
Sparta IL. The route the escapees traveled is not known, but it is known that by September 5, 1842,
they had arrived in Farmington IL. An account of what happened to them after that date is found
in Fighters for Freedom by Herman Muelder published in 1959. In December, 1842 Andrew Borders
was notified by Peter Frans, Sheriff of Knox County that his five servants were jailed in Galesburg IL.
Borders and his son, James traveled to Galesburg to claim them. Because Hannah Morrison&#x27;s term of
indenture had expired the year before, Borders made no claim for her, but he did claim Sukey and the
boys. However, Sukey was gone when he arrived (&quot;either ran away or was taken away&quot;) and he got

only her young sons. In February 1843, he sued William Hayes for trespass in aiding his servants in
escaping and asked for $2,500.00 in damages. This was a civil case tried in the Circuit Court of Perry
County at Pickneyville IL and judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff, Borders for $300.00 in
damages plus cost. The case was appealed to the Illinois Supreme Court where the judgment of the trial
court was affirmed with costs. This did not stop William from his underground railroad activities. In
1845, he hired a lawyer for his services in the case of &quot;The People vs. William Hayes and Daniel
Morrison&quot; for harboring a slave. This case was tried in the Clinton County Court in 1848. William
married, November 25, 1819, Anna Johnston (1800-1861); and born to them were:</div>
