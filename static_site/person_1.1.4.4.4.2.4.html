            <div class="person-text">(1.1.4.4.4.2.4) WILLIAM HENRY WALLACE born September 9, 1848 Philipstown,
Putnam, NY and died January 8, 1929 Fishkill, Dutchess, NY. William was a Civil War
veteran, having served in Company B and C, 6th New York Heavy Artillery; enlisting
March 2, 1864 at the age of 15 years at Terrytown, Westchester County NY; William’s
father signed a statement (false one) that William was 18 years of age, so he could enlist.
In a letter to the Commissioner of Pensions, in 1918, William wrote: AI enlisted the 2d
day of March, 1864 for three years or sooner. Shot with Co. B 6th Reg NY Heavy
Artillery. I was shipped from New York city in 10 days to Brandy Station in camp. When
Grant started on the march through the wilderness I was put in the 5th Corps under Gen.
Warren. I went through the Wilderness campaign. At the James River, crossed the river
at City Point before Lee got there and laid in Breastworks until after the fort was blown
up. I was wounded in the hip with a rifle bullet on the Welden railroad on the 3d day of
July. After the fort was blown up we were shippped to Washington, then to the
Shenandoah Valley until after the battle of Cedar Creek when we did Old Early up; then
shipped back to Bermuda Hundred. We laid there until Gen. Lee evacuated the works
then followed him to Nottaway court house. After Lee surrended we came back to
Petersburg and did guard duty until I was honorably discharged Aug. 24, 1865&quot;. After
his discharge, Willliam returned to Philipstown where he resided in Cold Spring until
1870 when he moved to Wappingers Falls; in 1877 he moved to Fishkill NY, where he
lived the rest of his days. He married, January 30, 1870 at Glenham, Dutchess, NY
Hester Knapp born July 29, 1846 NY and died April 17, 1928, Fishkill NY; both buried
there in the Fishkill Rural Cemetery (tombstone photo). In the 1870 Census, Willliam is
listed as a farm laborer living with his wife on the farm of Job Knapp (father-in-law?); in

the 1880 Census, he is listed as a laborer living in Wappingers Falls; in the 1900 Census,
he is listed as a nursery laborer. Born to them were:</div>
