            <div class="person-text">(4.5.3.1.2.3.6.10.3.1) MARY MARGERET BANNING married Gardner Louis Friedlander and they
had 3 kids
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Feb 24, 2001 by AMY RABIDEAU SILVERS
The time was World War II. Mary Banning, trained as a pilot, sat in the cockpit of a military aircraft,
flying somewhere in a dark, dark night. From the co- pilot&#x27;s seat, she could not see the runway.
That was the point. The pilot wore a light on his headgear. Its light searched for special mirrored
devices embedded along the edges of the runway. The reflective devices were so precise that only the pilot could see the
signals bouncing back. Even the co-pilot was, quite literally, in the dark. Banning was the scientist who produced the
reflective coating. When the plane touched down, her work was a success. Mary Banning Friedlander later married, moved
to the Milwaukee area, taught college and high school physics, raised children, and hunted for mushrooms and a hundred
other large and small pieces of life. A longtime Fox Point resident, she died Sunday in Iowa City, Iowa, where she moved
last year to live with her daughter. The cause of death was complications of emphysema. She was 85. &quot;She was a
remarkable woman,&quot; said her son, Gardner LeRoy Friedlander, physics teacher at University School of Milwaukee in River
Hills. &quot;Her specialty was optics, making thin films that would either filter out or pass through particular wavelengths of
light.&quot; Yet another project involved infrared goggles. &quot;With infra-red goggles, the pilot could see beautifully where the
runway was, but anybody near him -- an enemy fighter -- could not,&quot; Gardner said. &quot;And being a pilot, she understood what
the problems were.&quot; Friedlander grew up in Duluth, Minn. She became fascinated with physics, earning her degree as a Phi
Beta Kappa at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. She went on to do her doctoral work at Johns Hopkins University in
Baltimore. &quot;She worked at Johns Hopkins doing theoretical work until 1941,&quot; her son said. &quot;She knew many of the top
physicists.&quot; &quot;They began to disappear,&quot; his mother once told him. &quot;And we knew not to ask.&quot; The list included J. Robert
Oppenheimer, later the director of the Manhattan Project, which developed the first atomic bomb. She continued with her
post-doctoral fellowship at the University of Rochester in Rochester, N.Y., working with the government on optics projects
for the war effort. His mother was good at theoretical work but especially enjoyed &quot;the actual doing of it,&quot; Gardner said. She
married Gardner Louis Friedlander in 1947, moving to Milwaukee about a year later. Friedlander taught physics at the
Milwaukee Downer College and at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee for about eight years. When her children were
young, she did consulting work. Once, a local hospital called for help to calculate a formula for timing blood replacement
procedures. &quot;I can&#x27;t talk to you right now. I&#x27;m giving the baby a bath,&quot; she said, according to family lore. &quot;She figured it out
in her head and called them back with the answer,&quot; her son said. She later taught physics to engineering students at UWM
and worked as a substitute teacher at University School. She was fascinated by most things, at one point setting out to test
whether a divining rod, or dowsing rod, actually could find water. She found that it appeared to do so, repeatedly
reproducing experiments with her children and not-so-technical equipment, including bent coat hangers. In recent years, she
threw her investigative and analytical skills into genealogy. The effort included creating a detailed Web site with
information owhat had been verified and its sources. &quot;She&#x27;s someone who really enjoyed life, because she got so interested
in things,&quot; her son said. &quot;She would spend an enormous amount of time walking through woods, identifying birds,
wildflowers, trees. She found chanterelle mushrooms, made sure they were OK to eat and shared them with us. We&#x27;d collect
buckets of them.&quot; Other survivors include her daughter, Margaret Friedlander Brinig of Iowa City; another son, Thomas
Friedlander of Cascade; and grandchildren.
