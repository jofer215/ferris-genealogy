            <div class="person-text">(3.1.2.2.4.2.3.1) CAROLINE FERRIS born February 1, 1840 and died April 23, 1893; buried Ferris
Cemetery about 3 miles west of the village of Smyrna, Chenango, NY; married February 27, 1856 in
Smyrna, Thomas J. Hitchcock [son of (Thomas) Jeremiah &amp; Elizabeth (Crumb) Hitchcock] born
October 26, 1834 Fabius, Onondaga, NY and died August (10) 18, 1884 Ionia MI; buried Sebewa MI;
Thomas was a Private with Company D., 114th New York Volunteers, enlisting from Smyrna on
August 7, 1862; he was 5 feet 10 inches tall, with a dark complexion and gray eyes; wounded in the
head by a gunshot at Cedar Creek VA. October 19, 1864 and was discharged at Philadelphia PA, May
4, 1865. He was shot in the head, but the bullet didn’t go through the skull; it did a good deal of bone
and tissue with it when it bounced off. It is appears that about 5 years after getting discharged, Thomas
decided he wanted to go to Michigan where his sister Phidelia (Cordelia) and her family (Kenyon) were
living. Caroline didn’t want to go so he left her in NY and went by himself, giving the impression that
he was going to come back to NY. He didn’t and then ended up marrying another woman (Georgia
Traviss) there and having 3 kids with the other woman - he never divorced Caroline! [for info the other
kids are: Allice E.; Nelson J.; and Hattie L.] Both Caroline and the other woman, Georgia, applied for
his Civil War pension. Born to Caroline and Thomas were:</div>
