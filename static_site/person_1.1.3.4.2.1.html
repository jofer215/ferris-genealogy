            <div class="person-text">(1.1.3.4.2.1) HENRY POST MCGOWN, Judge, one of the incorporators and trustees of
the Harlem Savings Bank, NYC, 1863;
Presumably the same guy:
HENRY P. McGOWN was born and bred in Harlem; he joined Pocahontas Engine
Company No. 49 on October 5, 1842, as private. Six months later he was made
secretary, and the end of his first year of service found him foreman. The quarters of the
company were n Fourth Avenue, between One hundred and Twenty-sixth and OneHundred and Twenty-seventh Streets, where Engine No. 36 of the present Department is
stationed. It was the glory of 49&#x27;s boys that they were never &quot;washed themselves&quot; and
frequently washed their rivals. Once when the frozen surface of a stream had to be cut to
let down the suction pipe, Foremen McGown himself stood for hours up to his knees in
the icy water, holding the pipe under. He would not take a man from the engine, as he
wished to &quot;wash&quot; the machine just ahead. In racing to fire Hose 43 and Engine 35 were
&quot;Pocahontas&#x27;s&quot; chief opponents. One bitterly cold night the mansion of John a. Haven, at

Fort Washginton, took fire. Mr. Haven was a commission merchant with an office at No.
7 Beaver Street. The alarm was carried from steeple to steeple, and 43 Hose and 49
engine started for the rescue. Scarcely could a foothold be obtained upon the frozen
roads, and Beekman Hill was a glace of ice. Mr. Haven&#x27;s house was on the river bank at
the foot of a steep hill about four hundred feet long. The road into the merchant&#x27;s
grounds ran between two massive stone pillars. The Hose Company, which was slightly
in advance of No. 49, dashed recklessly down this icy incline. In vain the men at the
tongue strove to hold the carriage back. It shot like lightning down the hill, scattering the
firemen right and left and running over one, named Wilson. He died from his injuries.
Foreman McGown ordered his men to pass the ropes back under the engine, and hang on
with all their might. They obeyed, and No. 49 passed between the pillars with but little
damage. Mr. Haven&#x27;s stately house was in flames from roof to cellar. His three young
daughters had been rescued, but ran back to get some jewels. They had scarcely reentered when the walls fell and buried them. At daybreak, believing that he could be of
no further service, Foreman McGown directed his men to &quot;take up.&quot; Then Mr. Audubon,
son of the famous naturalist, approached and begged him to assist in exhuming the
bodies of the three girls. The family particularly desired No. 49 to remain. The men,
cold, stiffened, and weary though they were, consented, and the foreman grated Mr.
Audubon&#x27;s request. After the best breakfast obtainable, the sad task begun. Tools were
improvised by some men, and others worked with their bare hands. Several hours passed
before something white was seen beneath the blackened timbers. It was the skull of one
of the girls, denuded of flesh and hair, and bleached by the terrible heat. The right hand
had been burned away, and the head lay on the arm in the attitude of sleep. Within a
radius of a few feet were the bodies of the other girls. It was after noon when No. 49
finally &quot;took up.&quot; They had been at work eighteen hours.Mr. McGown studied law, and
was admitted to the bar in 1846. He is now justice of the Ninth District Court. He
resigned from the Department May 4, 1857.
