&quot;I&#x27;m Making Every Effort to Preserve&quot; DOROTHY LEAKE&#x27;S LOVE FOR THE OZARKS
EXCERPT:
&quot;I think I&#x27;m fortunate to have my retirement here. I like to do lots of things outdoors,&quot; said the spry eighty-six years young
doctor of freshwater biology, Dorothy V. Leake. Dr. Leake, being very interested in conserving and preserving the flora and
fauna of the Ozarks, has been interested in many projects since her retirement in 1959. Probably most important to her is her
efforts to slow down some of the detrimental ecological changes she sees occurring all over the Ozarks. &quot;One of the changes
going on I&#x27;m actively involved in is preserving the wildlife which would all be gone from here--the fish all gone from the
stream and the animals would be gone. All the things that grow here would be killed. I have &#x27;coons and &#x27;possums come up to
the back door and eat whatever I put out for them at night. People don&#x27;t pay very much attention to the environment as much
as they talk about it. They don&#x27;t really try to preserve it.&quot; Dr. Leake lives on a wooded acreage devoted to conservation.
Since their retirement, she and her husband have established a freshwater biology station with their chief goal being to
research the wildlife while it is still there and preserve as much as possible all aspects of Crane Creek and its adjacent areas.
Since her husband&#x27;s death in 1978, she has continued this work alone. &quot;I haven&#x27;t time to get lonely,&#x27;&#x27; she said, &quot;I&#x27;m busy all
the time. Of course, I&#x27;m lonely for my husband. He was a great companion. We did everything together.&quot; Crane Creek, a
tributary of the James River, runs through her property, giving her a natural laboratory right beside her house where she can
do her research. &quot;The creek rises at the railroad at the corner of our place. Years ago they made an embankment for the
railroad by shooting off the face of the bluff. The spring which had come out at the base of the bluff managed to penetrate
the embankment and is still the head of Crane Creek. &quot;Streams like this one are all diminishing in size. They&#x27;re becoming
polluted and not as useful as they once were. So, I had the idea of doing research here. I have done all the biological
research that has been done here and published some papers, but there is a lot of work that could still be done. With so many

members of the animal and plant kingdoms, it is an inexhaustible study which I think ought to be recorded before the stream
deteriorates as it&#x27;s bound to do in this day and age. &quot;Above and beyond that I enjoy living here very much. I have never
lived anywhere I liked as much as I like the Ozarks. I think it&#x27;s a special section of the country that&#x27;s ideal.&quot;
A VISIT WITH DOROTHY LEAKE
I was born in Columbus Junction, Iowa, in 1893. That&#x27;s a town close to the Mississippi River in a wooded area where there
were lots of these pretty spring flowers everyone loves so much. I got my first experience with nature there. At the turn of
the century, when I was seven years old, my father, who was a lawyer, moved his family from the hills, streams and woods
of southeastern Iowa to the prairies and granite mountains of the southwest corner of Oklahoma. The country was quite
different there. We lived in a town called Granite. It was called this because it was at the end of the Wichita range which is
just piles of red granite rising right up out of the prairie with no foothills at all. Of course, there was a lot of vegetation all
over between the rocks, but the rocks were the most prominent things about the mountains. We lived halfway up one of the
mountains which was only about 800 feet high. There was a spring on a level place at the middle of the mountain, and we
had two houses we lived in. In one house we had the living room and bedrooms, and in the other house we had a kitchen,
dining room and storeroom. They must have been a hundred feet apart, so we had to run from one place to the other. Since
there were pretty little clear streams that ran down the mountains, it was a great place to study nature. The game hadn&#x27;t been
shot out of the country as it has now. There were lots of different kinds of western type animals like lizards and snakes that
lived on the mountains. Lots of rabbits, too. When I went to college in Springfield at Drury College, in 1910, the country in
the Ozarks was so much like the country in Iowa I had liked a great deal that I really felt at home here, more so than in arid
Oklahoma. I liked the climate and wildlife so much better. I had a chance to study biology in school, developed in that line
still more and took my bachelor&#x27;s degree and the year after that my master&#x27;s degree. That was 1914 and 1915. Then after a
period of teaching years, a college romance resulted in marriage in 1919 to Harold Henderson Leake, a teacher of piano and
voice. Our first seven years of married life were spent on this place where I now live. When our daughter was born, my
father came up from western Oklahoma to see his new grandchild, and he was so taken with the water and the trees and all
the wildlife, he decided he&#x27;d just get out and buy a place while he was up here. He was a lawyer, and he wanted to move his
other son-in-law up here to start a practice. My husband and I knew about this place and had been here and sat on that ledge
of rock down there at the corner and wished that we could live in a place like this. We directed him to this place, and he fell
in love with it, too, and bought it. Then he couldn&#x27;t persuade his other son-in-law to come up here at all because he liked the
prairies better. So he asked us if we would come down here to live, which we did. Our daughter, Marcelotte, and son,
Benjamin, were born here where the family enjoyed the country life. We supplemented the music teaching income with
general farming--we had a garden, pigs, chickens and cows. This was our first experience with farming, either one of us. We
just fell right into it, loved it, but we couldn&#x27;t make a living at it. The children had a Shetland pony, although she was
definitely not a producer of anything but amusement. I taught my daughter by the Calvert school method so much used at
that time by foreign missionary parents. When she was ready for the third grade, we moved to Aurora and I conducted a
kindergarten with my five year old son as one of the &quot;kinders.&quot; Next year came the chance to teach in the newly organized
Junior College at Monett. Mr. Leake was head of the music department and I head of the science department. There was a
time in the late 20&#x27;s when they organized junior colleges in this area. This school has since closed. They didn&#x27;t keep it up
more than fifteen years, I think. Henderson Leake was involved in several vocations, including teaching music, broadcasting
and preaching. After five years of this pleasant work we were offered attractive positions in Oklahoma. Mr. Leake became
director of Educational Radio at the university of Oklahoma at Norman, and later at Oklahoma State University at
Stillwater. I taught botany at both these schools. I was fifty years old when I took my doctorate degree at the University of
Oklahoma in &#x27;44, taking my degree at the same time my son took his bachelor&#x27;s degree. They weren&#x27;t so particular then
about how old you were, but I believe you had to do more work then than you do now. After acquiring the doctoral degree, I
became head of the biology department of Southeastern State university at Durant. We built this house in &#x27;51. The house on
the hill my grandchildren live in is the house that was on the place when we moved here. We lived in it seven years. My
husband was for many years the director of Educational Radio at the University of Oklahoma and at Stillwater State
University. He was at both those schools, as I was. His radio name was Henderson Leake because Henderson sounded better
than Harold in broadcasting. He had a commercial program with KWTO [Springfield, Missouri] for almost three years.
They called it &quot;Between the Windows.&quot; He wrote his broadcast between the windows in the living room here. He did this
for Producers&#x27; Creamery. It was a program of general events, historical matters, weather and nature things. He described, for
instance, what he saw out the window. He could see what was going on in the creek and something goes on every day that&#x27;s
interesting. The kingfishers were flying up and down the creek or the muskrats were swimming around. When retirement

time came, my versatile husband became a priest of the Episcopal Church, working mostly in the churches of northern
Arkansas. We had four trips abroad. The first was to Canterbury, England, where we attended a summer session of theology
lectures at St. Augustine&#x27;s College. The
second was to attend the performances of Wagner&#x27;s Four Ring Operas at Bayreuth, after which we toured Europe in a VW
camper bus-- especially visiting the cathedrals of England. The third trip was to spend fall and winter in the Thomas Hardy,
Jane Austen (and the modern John Fowles) country of Dorset. The fourth trip was when my husband exchanged pulpits with
an Anglican priest for three summer months. Mr. Sims of Haxey, Lincolnshire, England, came to my husband&#x27;s church in
Idabel, Oklahoma, while my husband had charge of St. Nicholas&#x27; church at Haxey. All these years since we left the farm for
teaching positions, the homing instinct has brought us back as often as possible. In 1951 we built our retirement home and
prepared to carry on our conservation and research activities here. The place is a natural for such work. It is an old grist mill
site on the headwaters of Crane Creek. The Wissman Mill was not in use when we had come here in the 20&#x27;s but was still
standing until the 1940&#x27;s. Crane Creek is very rich in all kinds of plant and animal life, so rich that it would take years to
study it completely. It&#x27;s one of the few streams left in the Ozarks that is not badly polluted. There are so many streams being
polluted by town sewage and dump places that plants and animals cannot live in them. We have offered the use of the
station to the schools of the area interested in doing biological research here. The professors are younger than I am and they
can get out and do the field work better than I can now. So I&#x27;m going to kind of turn it over to them. I&#x27;m expecting them to
do some work. My own research has
been on the ecology, physiology and taxonomy of algae. We call our acres on the creek The Freshwater Biology Station. It
is also a wildlife refuge, teeming with all sorts of flora and fauna. There are plants of great variety and beauty. Some of the
animals are ground hogs, muskrats, chipmunks, many kinds of mice, skunks, &#x27;coons, squirrels and beavers. More than a
hundred species of birds have been recorded at the station. Many kinds of fish live in the stream, trout, bass, perch and
pickerel, and there are other aquatic vertebrates and innumerable invertebrates. Our aim is to preserve the station in as
natural a state as possible, and to protect it from the destructive impact of so-called civilization. We want it to be useful to
researchers and helpful to groups like the girl scouts and the biology classes in the schools of the surrounding towns. What
my ambition is with respect to my research is to have a record of this kind of clear creek, which is getting rare in Missouri.
Because I feel it is impossible for things not to change, as change is a rule of life, my work will be to make some record of
what it was like, a history of it, as it goes ahead with these changes that are inevitable. Another motive I have is to make the
place as useful as possible to people, not just to sit here and live as a selfish individual, but to share it with people and have
them learn about it and enjoy it, too.
