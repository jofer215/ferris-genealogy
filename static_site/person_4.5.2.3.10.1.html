            <div class="person-text">(4.5.2.3.10.1) HANFORD LOCKWOOD (#1321) (Photo) born June 7, 1808 Greenwich, Fairfield, CT
and died there at his home January 27, 1896; worked on his father’s farm summers and attended the
district school winters until he was 15 years of age, when he went to New York City, and became a
clerk in the employ of William J. Romer, a grocer, for five dollars a month. At the end of the first year
he had saved more than thirty dollars, which he gave to his father, besides having properly clothed
himself, this was the beginning of a successful business life. On account of sickness he returned home
and remained 2 years, working on his father’s farm; subsequently returned to New York, and entered
the grocery store of his brother-in-law, Isaac Ostrander, as clerk at eight dollars a month for one year,
then received twelve dollars his second year, and fifteen dollars for his third year’s work. The summer
that he was 22 he spent at home, and during the fall and winter following taught school at twelve
dollars a month, and the following spring engaged for one year to teach in what was known as the Nash
District at fifteen dollars a month, and “boarded around”. He relates that he had a good time and made
many warm friends. During this time he made the acquaintance of Susan, daughter of James Nash, the
man who had engaged him to teach school, and on the 6th of October, 1830, they were married. In the
month of April 1831, he commenced business as a grocer in the city of New York, and continued in that
business for 24 years, when he retired from active employment and returned to his native town, and
resided on the old homestead where he first saw the light of day until February 1878 when he moved to
his final residence in 1880. During his residence in the city he made good investments in real estate,
which greatly increased in value on his hands. He was a first-class businessman, and attributes his
success in life more to the fact that at an early age he became interested in the cause of religion, under
the influence of one Mary Ostrander, and united with the Methodist Episcopal Church under the
ministry of the Rev. William Jewett. Hanford was one of the most worthy and influential members of
the Methodist Episcopal Church at Greenwich; “one of the staunchest friends Connecticut Methodism
ever had”; He held various offices of the church, such as steward, trustee, recording secretary, licensed
exhorter, Sunday-school Superintendent for many years, and a worker in the Sunday-school as teacher.
He was always very liberal to his church as well as to other denominations, and the poor have in him a
true friend and they do not go empty away. He was the possessor of more than 500 acres of land, 215 of
which were the beautiful farm called Grandview. According to an unidentified newspaper clipping
containing his obit, he left a wife and son. He married 1st October 6, 1830 Susan Nash born July 14,
1812 and died October 27, 1869; 2d, also her 2d marriage January 31, 1872 Fanny (Roscoe) Lounsbury
[dau of William &amp; Anna (Browne) Roscoe] born July 20, 1831 and died March 5, 1921 Greenwich;
(where are they buried?) and born to him and Fanny was:</div>
