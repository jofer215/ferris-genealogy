            <div class="person-text">(1.1.4) CALEB FERRIS born February 10, 1732/c1740 Westchester Co NY and died
December 25, 1795; resided in Wayne Co (New Rochelle?) NY – in the 1790 census, he
is listed as living in Kortright, Delaware Co; married Judah (Helena Pell?) (1734-1820)
and born to them were (birth sequence may not be right) [Jim - according to
documentation provided by Brian Harris, Caleb either married more than once or the

above wife is incorrect, because Brian&#x27;s documentation says Caleb married Susannah
Lord (1740-1785) - also shows different date of birth and date of death as (1737-1790) based on this information, I have added Elizabeth as a child of Caleb][there is
considerable conflicting information on this twig of the Tree - some even question the
placement of Caleb as a son of Peter - some question whether he is even descended from
Jeffrey. Thus the following information should be considered speculative and I ask those
involved in this twig to conduct personal research.] The heirs of Caleb made a
renouncement: &quot;We, James Ferris, Caleb Ferris, Joseph Ferris, John LeConte and
Hannah, his wife, heirs of Caleb Ferris, late of New Rochelle in the County of
Westchester, who died intestate, do hereby severally renounce our several rights and
claims to Administration upon the estate of the deceased and recommend the same be
granted to Daniel Ferris, our brother. Witness our hands and seals the twenty-six day of
December, 1795&quot;. Also Caleb&#x27;s wife, Helena, renounced also in favor of her son Daniel,
December 26, 1795. Born to Caleb and wife was:</div>
