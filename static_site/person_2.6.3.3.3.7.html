(2.6.3.3.4) SAMUEL KETCHEM claimed that he always agreed with his father in supporting the
British cause. On only one occasion had he carried arms against them, when the British troops marched
to Amber he said he was forced to turn out in the militia to oppose them, but in doing his duty General
Arnold who commanded the rebel forces ordered him and a few more Tories to be shut up in a house
and burned alive. He escaped. Later he hired a substitute to take his place in the militia. He left
Norwalk with General Tryson’s forces in 1779, taking his family to Lloyd’s Neck where he lived on a
lumber farm and supported himself by cutting wood. He went on several expeditions into Connecticut
after joining the British forces. Losses claimed: furniture burned in his father’s house Ł60, 4 horses
which he got from the Loyalists at different times by helping them escape; two horses he purchased, 2
cows, 24 sheep, saddle and bridle taken by rebel captain, Ł27 lawful currency. He worked land on the
share and had some corn in the ground when he left home.</div>
