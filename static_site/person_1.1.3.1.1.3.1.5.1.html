MASON PRATT PEARSALL, SR., age 80, died on Sunday, September 30, 2001. The
son of Chester Burdick and Roxana Pratt Pearsall, he was born on March 9, 1921 in
Rochester, New York, where he grew up and graduated High School in 1939. As a young
man he was interested in Boy Scouts (Eagle Scout), sailing, ham radio, playing the
trumpet (jazz) and running cross-country and the mile on the school track teams. He
attended Lehigh University from 1939 to January, 1943, receiving a B.S. Degree in
Chemical Engineering. His six children were born between 1947 and 1960. After
college, he went to work for the Naugatuck Chemical Co. in Connecticut helping
develop a synthetic rubber manufacturing process as part of the war effort. He worked
for several small chemical manufacturing companies in Connecticut and Maryland
before establishing the Clinton Chemical Co. in Clinton, New Jersey in 1953 to produce
anhydrous aluminum chloride, an industrial catalyst. This business, started part time
while he supported his family with consulting work in New York, later became Pearsall
Chemical Co. He ran the company for 27 years, eventually becoming the largest U.S.
producer of aluminum chloride, as well as a significant factor in several other specialty
chemical businesses. In 1980, the business was sold to Witco Corp. His hobbies as an
adult included golf and tennis, and later running. He completed several marathons,
including the Houston and Boston marathons in 1978. He had a life-long interest in
airplanes, earning a private pilot license in the early fifties and later adding instrument
and multi-engine ratings. He owned and operated more than a dozen different airplanes,
which he used for business and personal travel and eventually accumulated more than
4,000 hours flying time. After retirement, he became interested in soaring and obtained a
glider rating. In his late sixties, he acquired two different aerobatic airplanes and began
participating in aerobatic competitions. From the late nineteen sixties till the late
nineteen eighties, he owned a number of boats, mostly sailboats. His main interest was
cruising; however, he did become interested in racing for one or two seasons, and
(around 1971) captured first in class in the Southern Ocean Racing Circuit in a 41 foot
C&amp;C sloop. After retirement in 1980, he lived on several different boats and cruised the
waters of New England, Southern California, Hawaii, Baja and the Gulf of California,
through the Panama Canal into the Caribbean, the Windward and Leeward Islands,
Florida, the Bahamas, and Bermuda. In 1996, he and his wife, Shirley, moved to Belize,
where they built a bungalow on the coast near Corazol. They lived there until returning
to Houston this spring for medical treatment. He was a quiet man. He was generally
modest in success. He had many plans and projects, and rarely complained or became
cynical or bitter when met with misfortune. Mason is survived by his wife, Shirley
Pearsall; daughters, Holly Kilpatrick of East Bangor, PA and Deborah Pearsall of Mt.

Bethel, PA; sons, Richard Pearsall, Mason Pearsall, Jr., James Pearsall, all of Houston,
and John Pearsall of Easton, PA; 12 grandchildren; one great grandson; sisters, Molly
Pearsall Dickson and Alice Pearsall Tilley; and numerous nieces, nephews and other
