Hazzard’s History of Henry County1822-1906
Not so many years ago Henry County was noted for its aged practicing physicians, most of who, however, have
now passed off the stage, giving place to a new generation. The older generation of physicians followed their profession
under the most trying conditions, braving the cold and snows of Winter, the storms and floods of Spring and Summer and
facing the most serious difficulties and dangers inseparable from a wild and new land, and they are the real heroes of the
early settlement and subsequent development of the country. Such pioneer physicians as Joel Reed, John Darr, William M.
Kerr; James V. Wayman, George W. Riddle, William F. Boor, George W. Ballengall, John S. Guisinger, Joseph Weeks, John
Rea, William B. Shockley, Luther W. Hess, Joseph W. Whitesel, Isaac Mendenhall, Samuel Ferris, Robert B Griffis, Roland
T. Summers, William M. Bartlett, Jonathan Ross, and others, are each entitled to honorable mention and their names should
be forever preserved in the annuals of Henry County. The new generation of physicians find their duties comparatively easy
and altogether free from the discomforts and dangers which surrounded those who in the language of early times “blazed the
way.”
Among the younger physicians of the county is Dr. Edgar Samuel Ferris, who is the second son of the late Dr.
Samuel &amp; Margaret (Lohr) Ferris. He was born in New Castle, Henry County, Indiana, April 9, 1864, and was educated in
the public schools of his native town. He was strongly attracted toward the profession of medicine and like his father began
to study the art at the age of eighteen. He pursued his studies under the direction of his father for a couple of years and then
entered the Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from which he was graduated in 1885. He subsequently
took a post-graduate course at the Chicago Polyclinic, having in the meantime entered upon the practice of his profession at
New Castle, in partnership with his father. This business union continued uninterruptedly until 1898, when the elder Dr.
Ferris retired from active practice. Dr. Edgar S. Ferris continued the business until the Spring of 1902, at which time he
concluded to give up the general practice of medicine and confine himself to diseases of the eye, ear, nose and throat.
He closed his office and went to Philadelphia, where he entered upon a course of study relating to these various
organs at the Polyclinic. He subsequently crossed the ocean to London, England, and there attended the lectures at the Royal
Ophthalmic Hospital and the Central Nose, Throat and Ear College. After his return from London, he established his office

at Indianapolis and practiced there for several months. He then returned to New Castle, where down to the present time he
has given his undivided attention to a constantly increasing and highly successful practice.
The special branch of the profession to which he gives his attention is a highly important one and requires
constant and unceasing study to keep abreast of the development of modern scientific treatment of disease, and the
practitioner has but little time for matters outside of his chosen field; but Dr. Ferris is notably industrious and has no idle
moments. He is a member of the County, State and National Medical societies and was for three years a member of the
Board of Trustees of New Castle, in which position he acquitted himself to the complete satisfaction of the community. He
was also for several years the very competent secretary of the County Board of Health. Politically, he has always been a
Republican and is an earnest supporter of the principles of that party. Besides his activity in his profession and politics, he
has also shown a disposition to aid the growth and prosperity of his native town.
Dr. Ferris is an urbane gentleman and by his pleasant manners invites the esteem and confidence of the
community. He is quick in decision, quick to act and firm in his opinions. He is a man of fine character, high attainments
and increasing reputation in his profession.
On March 23, 1887, at the home of her parents near Cadiz, Henry County, Indiana, Dr. Edgar S. Ferris married
Minnie M., the fifth daughter of Robert H. and Margaret (Haworth) Cooper. Dr. and Mrs. Ferris have had born to them one
child which died in infancy. They are members of the Methodist Episcopal Church and are constant in attention to their
religious duties.
Dr. Ferris is an enthusiastic member of the Masonic Order. He has taken all of the degrees of Ancient Craft
Masonry, the Royal Arch Chapter, the Council, the Knights Templar, and the Scottish Rite, including the Thirty Second
Degree, and is likewise a member of the Mystic Shrine. He has given a great deal of thought and study to Masonic history
and is familiar with the unwritten work of the order. He is frequent in his attendance upon its meetings and so far as possible
practices the grand precepts and principles. He is also a member of that large sister order, the Knights of Pythias. Counting
by years he is still a young man but he is old in experience. Using the term in an entirely complimentary sense, he is “a chip
of the old block,” and following in the footsteps of his father, Dr. Samuel Ferris, the resumption is that in the coming years,
he may more than merit the distinction attaching to the name of that well known and highly honored old school physician.
