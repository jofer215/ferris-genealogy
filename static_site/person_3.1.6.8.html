            <div class="person-text">(3.1.6.8) CHLOE (CLOE) CANFIELD (BNNS-L6) born December 20, 1748 Ridgefield, Fairfield, CT
and died after 1800 Ontario, Canada; married c1766 at Arlington/Manchester VT, Samuel Rose, Jr.
(2869-B6) [son of Samuel &amp; Sarah] born February 17, 1744/45 Amenia, Dutchess, NY and died 1789
St John, Quebec, Canada. Samuel was a United Empire Loyalist (or traitor, or maybe, an English
Sympathizer, depending on your point of view) and fled to Canada. He was an Army storekeeper and
spy for the British Army during the Revolution. All of the children after 1777 were born in a refugee
camp, probably in Quebec. All of his property was lost to the rebels in the US. In the area that was
then known as the New Hampshire Grants, but is now in Vermont, Samuel Rose, formerly of Amenia
(Nine Partners) NY, built the first log house in 1764, in the southwestern corner of the Township of
Bennington. In 1769, he also built the first framed house in the settlement. This was a very turbulent
period as, at the time, the area was claimed by two Royal Provinces - New Hampshire and New York.
The Governor of New York declared all New Hampshire grants null and void and began regranting of a
reign of influential land-grabbers, which included some of the officials of the province. New
Hampshire declined to defend the titles it had granted. In 1767, the Bennington settlers sent an envoy
to London. The King ordered a stay of proceedings until he could determine the rights of the matter.
New York ignored the decree. The first rumbling of the storm were heard in October of 1769, when
officers from Albany attempted to survey new lines near Bennington. There followed various events such as confiscation of lands - leading to the formation of the ‘Green Mountain Boys’ and the events
leading to the American Revolution. A notable confiscation was that of the Rose Family in the
southwestern part of town. Samuel had led the original group of settlers. Some of his sons turned
Loyalist. According to local legend, Samuel had organized the Tory party just before the Bennington
Campaign (August, 1777). This estate was confiscated in September 1777. The family left Bennington
in 1778. Family was refugee camp in Quebec until they received a land grant of 200 acres at
Edwardsburg on the St. Lawrence River. Born to them were:</div>
