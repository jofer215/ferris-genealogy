            <div class="person-text">(1.1) PETER FERRIS born c1669 (other dates are found, but will stay with Chaplain
Ferris) [some of these birth dates are obviously impossible, considering his mother,
Mary was supposedly born c1658.] [probably the 3d born of John] in Westchester Co
NY and died after 1764.[mentioned in his father’s will]; married December 28, 1725,
probably at Eastchester, Susannah Fowler born c1689/90. Peter was a farmer and the
first Ferris to reside in Eastchester, Westchester, NY; he owned several tracts of land in
Westchester Co including 279 acres in the Long Reach Patent of Eastchester he received
from his brother-in-law, Moses Fowler, in 1729; 1730, he bought the rights of David
Jamison to the tract of land known as Harrison’s Purchase, in Rye; for this claim,
comprising one fifth of the whole tract, he gave fifteen pounds; and sold it or gave it, the
same year, to Peter Stringham, of Rye. On July 25, 1749, Peter offered to sell what claim
he possessed to land in the Manor of Fordham, such as it was, to Trinity Church. The
Church decided the claim was not good, but would accept it if Peter wished to give it to
them; it is presumed Peter kept it.
