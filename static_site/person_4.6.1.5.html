            <div class="person-text">(4.6.1.5) EBENEZER LOCKWOOD (#239) (Major) born March 31, 1737 Stamford CT and died July
29, 1821 Pound Ridge NY; married (consort) 1st February 16, 1761 Hannah Smith [dau of Ezra Smith
&amp; Mary Weed] who died May 3, 1787 at age 45 years; married 2d Sarah Waring who died March 3,
1821 at age 67 years. Ebenezer’s early years were spent on the farm with his father, engaged in
agricultural pursuits. After his father’s death, the estate of some 400-500 acres were divided among
himself and his older brother. At the age of 25 he was engaged in merchandise, and was appointed one
of his Majesty’s Justices of the Peace and one of the Quorum, which offices he held until the
commencement of the Revolutionary War. On October 19, 1775, he was commissioned a Major in the
2d Regiment of Westchester County Militia, commanded by Colonel Thomas Thomas, and was in
active service during most of the campaign of ‘76, when the enemy took possession of the lower part of
Westchester County. In May, 1776, he attended the Provincial Congress then sitting in New York,
having been elected to that office on the third Tuesday in April previous for one year, and was in
continued served from that period until the close of the war, either as Major, Member of the Provincial
Congress, Committee of Safety, and other posts of active duty in favor of American Independence.
After the Declaration of Independence he was elected a member of the Provincial Convention for
forming a constitution of Government for the State, and as such aided in the formation and adoption of
the first Constitution and was returned as a member of the Legislature for several years after the close
of the war. His unwearied zeal and activity in the American cause also was accompanied with much
pecuniary loss and sacrifice of property. On July 3, 1779, a detachment of British troops under the
command of Colonel Tarleton made a sudden descent upon the village of Pound Ridge and one of the
objects of the attack was the capture of Major Lockwood, for whom a reward of forty guineas had been
offered. His house was burnt with most of its contents, Hannah was cut and maltreated, and the
livestock was driven off. After the close of the War, he and his family returned to his farm, converted a
barn into a dwelling and was honored with the appointment of first Judge of County Court. Member 2d
Board of Regents of the University of New York. About the year 1795, he retired from all public

employment and spent the remainder of his days in the circle of his family and friends until his death.
