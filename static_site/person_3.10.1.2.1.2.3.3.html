Topeka - Union officer in General Sherman’s march to the sea - in 1868, he was clerk of the Circuit
Court, Rock Co WI. He was involved in the “contest over the Osage ceded lands”, which was a contest
in the federal courts with the railroad companies for the ownership of the former Osage lands. “The
suits were first initiated in the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Kansas, by George
R. Peck, U. S. District Attorney, who filed bills therein against the railroad companies to establish title
of the United States to the ceded Osage lands, amount to 960,000 acres. The case was argued in the
court in June 1874. The attorneys for the Government were George R. Peck, U.S. District Attorney,
…… The prayer of the bill was granted by the Circuit Court. An appeal was taken to the U.S. Supreme
Court, before which body the case was argued in October 1875. In the Supreme Court the government
was represented by U.S. District Attorney Peck… The Supreme Court affirmed the decree of the
Circuit Court and the settlers were victorious.”</div>
