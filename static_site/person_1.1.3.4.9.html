            <div class="person-text">(1.1.3.4.9) JULIA ELIZABETH FERRIS born May 1823 and died October 1879;
married Solomon B. Noble and born to them was:
Don’t know if this is the same Solomon B. Noble: Solomon Belden NOBLE, who died at the residence of his son, District
Attorney, Daniel NOBLE, at 73 Remsen street, Astoria, and whose remains were cremated at Fresh Pond, L. I., last
Wednesday, was for some years a resident of 64 Second place, this city. He born at Williamstown, Mass., and was graduated
from Williams college in his 19th year in the class of &#x27;37. Mr. Noble was descended from old Puritan stock. His ancestor,
Thomas NOBLE, came from England and settled in Westfield, Mass. in 1640. Mr. NOBEL&#x27;S grandfather graduated from
Yale College before the revolution. He was a judge of the supreme court of Massachusetts and one of the founders of
Williams College. Solomon B. NOBLE&#x27;s father, Daniel NOBLE, also a lawyer, was a graduate of Williams College,
member of the governor&#x27;s council and at the time of his death candidate for Lieutenant governor. His memory is still held in
grateful remembrance by the faculty of Williams, as it was due to his efforts and influence with the governor that Williams
College was not consolidated with Amherst. His protrait hangs in the library at Williamstown. S. B. NOBEL&#x27;S mother was
Esther Belden WOLCOTT of Wolcottville, Conn., a direct descendant of Oliver WOLCOTT, one of the signers of the
Declaration of Independence.</div>
