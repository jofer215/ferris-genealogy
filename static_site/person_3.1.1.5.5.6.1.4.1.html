            <div class="person-text">(3.1.1.5.5.6.1.4.1) JAMES SHELBY MILES Jr born June 5, 1888 IL and died 1977 Menard Co IL;
married Virginia Williams (1918-1964); both buried Farmers Point Cemetery, Tallula, Menard, IL photos
&quot;(1974) James Miles went to the Illinois State Fair for the first time in 1900 and he hasn&#x27;t missed
one since, with the exception of 1918 when he was serving with the U.S. Army.
Miles will be one of the early arrivals at the fair today and very likely he will be there every day
of the 1974 exhibit. He&#x27;s a spry 86 and will cover the grounds on foot as he always has.
Setting records is not the purpose of his visits to the fair -- he has been wrapped up in fair history
as far back as he can remember.
His father, J. S. Miles, at one time president of the State Fair Board, is the man responsible for
the fair being held in Springfield today. During Governor Len Small&#x27;s administration, there was talk of
moving the fair to Peoria. J. S. Miles was convinced the fair belonged in Springfield and it was only
after his personal plea to Gov. Small that the latter decided to keep the exhibit in the capital. He spent
the next eight years working with the fair and didn&#x27;t receive one penny, his son says.
James Shelby Miles (he was named for Shelby M. Cullom, one-time governor of Illinois and
later U.S. senator) has an impressive record of association with the fair. He first exhibited in 1909 and
carried off a ribbon for a Berkshire boar. He went back in 1911 and received awards for junior
champion boar and junior champion gilt.
Miles likes to reminisce about the &quot;Golden Age of Fairs,&quot; when the Illinois exhibit was the big
event of the year, attracting visitors from all over the state. The Fair, he says, was a family event in
those days. People came with picnic baskets and spread a bounteous meal on the grass. They stayed
from early morning until late at night. These were the days of simple pleasures and Miles wishes they
could return. &quot;It&#x27;s all different now,&quot; he adds.
During the heyday of fairs, Miles was superintendent of the Illinois State Fair swine department
while Gov. Small was in office. He also served as superintendent of the national swine show held in
Peoria in the &#x27;20s. A farmer and livestock raiser in Menard County for many years, Miles was an
exhibitor and judge not only in Illinois but also across the country from New York to California.
A souvenir of his exhibiting days is a framed certificate with blue ribbon for grand champion
barrow, winner over all breeds, received at the International Live Stock Show in Chicago in 1921. The
certificate shows pictures of Miss Mary Judy, Tallula, owner of the winning Berkshire, and Miles, the
breeder and showman.

Menard county history is another subject he likes to talk about and his keen memory brings to
life many important events of bygone days. It is no wonder he is steeped in the history of the county
made famous by Lincoln&#x27;s connection with it. His grandfather, John Purkapile, came to Menard in
1822 and in 1824 he received a land grant signed by John Quincy Adams. His grandfather, James
Purkapile cast his first vote in the county while Abraham Lincoln was clerk.
Miles remembers well when William Randolph Hearst bought the land where New Salem State
Park is located and donated it to the Old Salem Chautauqua Association, with the idea that a state park
be located there. Miles is the last surviving member of the 12-man committee named to establish that
historical landmark. &quot;While the legislature was in session,&quot; he recalls, &quot;we invited them out to look
over the property. Dave Shanahan was the speaker and I remember meeting some of them with my old
car. The women gave them a big dinner in the old Harrison Opera House.&quot; On April 3, 1918 the
legislature voted to take over the land for a state park, and the Old Salem Chautauqua Association with
Mr. Hearst&#x27;s consent, deeded the 62 acres to the state for the restoration of New Salem village.
In recent years Miles has held several positions with the state. He was a guard in the treasurer&#x27;s
office and recently at the Archives Building. From 1953 to 1960 he worked with Illinois Institutional
Farms. He is particularly proud of this program which, he says, made the handicapped and prison
inmates self-sufficient and provided an important type of rehabilitation.&quot;
