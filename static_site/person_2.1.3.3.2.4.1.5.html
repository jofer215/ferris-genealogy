            <div class="person-text">(2.1.3.3.2.4.1.5) JARED KNAPP SMITH, M.D., (Photo) born December 23, 1849 Koloa, Hauai, HI
and died 1897; followed his father into medicine; graduated from College of Physicians and Surgeons,
New York City, 1876 and served in a hospital in Brooklyn; 1897 returned to the islands and was the
government physician at Koloa and had the duty to determine who had leprosy (which meant exile);
elected president of the Kauai Telephone Co, 1884; on September 27, 1897, while writing a letter to his
future bride (Margaret Brewster), he answered a knock at the door and was shot in the heart, dying
instantly, by a man who was trying to prevent Jared from signing an order sending away a young girl
suspected of having leprosy, to the Leper Colony on the island of Molokai. [Jim - interesting - in my
travels conducting site investigations of former military sites that were used as bombing targets, I have
been to this Leper Colony - this island during WWII had a bombing target on it and practice bombs,
with live charges, are still there, today - 1997.]</div>
