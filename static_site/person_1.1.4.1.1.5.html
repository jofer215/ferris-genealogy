HON. NELSON FERRIS CLOSES HIS LONG AND CREDITABLE CAREER
Mishawaka Enterprise Mishawaka, Indiana Friday, October 27, 1899
Death has been very busy of late cutting down the few remaining pioneers of
Mishawaka that noble band of hardy settlers whose energy and thrift first made possible
the development of our present wonderfully prosperous surroundings and another
prominent name was added to the list on Tuesday morning last when Hon. Nelson Ferris
passed peacefully away at his home on East Fourth Street. Mr. Ferris had been a man of
remarkable health and vigor and sickness was a thing almost unknown to him. He
simply wore out, and his end, which and been gradually approaching for some time was
merely dropping into an eternal sleep. Although lacking the advantage of an early
education, Mr. Ferris was a man of vigorous mentality, a ready wit and keen tongue. He
was an original and ardent Republican, and during the dark days of the war while

serving as county sheriff, was a power in the community. Many interesting
reminiscences could he and his compatriots relate of those stirring days. At the time of
his election as sheriff, Mr. Ferris ran a sawmill at Ferrisville, south of town, which place
was named for him. Before and subsequent to this; he resided in Mishawaka, where he
for years successfully conducted the old gristmill which stood at the foot of Mill Street
and which was burned down some 20 years ago. Of late years he spent much of his time
with his son, Waverly, looking after his extensive farming property near the town of
Mendon, MI. Nelson Ferris born in Hentz, Cayuga County, New York, November 6,
1817. When 16 years old he moved to Seneca Falls, NY, where he served an
apprenticeship in the miller&#x27;s trade, which he followed for 25 years. Upon leaving
Seneca Falls in May of 1842, he came to Mishawaka and engaged in milling and other
business interests. In 1860 he was elected sheriff of St. Joseph County, holding that
office during the next four trying years of war and acquitted himself in a manner highly
satisfactory to the people. In the fall of 1866 he was elected to represent St. Joseph
County in the Indiana legislature and during his term of two years had the honor of
voting for the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. As a member of
the legislature he served on the committee of claims, prisons and appropriations. In 1850
he was appointed one of the Deputy Marshal&#x27;s to take the census of St. Joseph County.
Mr. Ferris was married to Miss Sally Weeks in Pamelia, NY, on January 1, 1841. Mr. and
Mrs. Ferris commenced their married life in Alloway, NY. To them were born four
children, the eldest of who, a son, Morton E., died in Mishawaka, a promising boy of 11
years. Mrs. James K Gore, of Indianapolis, W W Ferris, of Mendon, MI, Mrs. A L
Osborn, Jr., of Laporte, with his ever-faithful wife mourns his loss. The funeral was held
from the residence, 109 East Fourth Street, yesterday afternoon at 2:30 o&#x27;clock, Rev. H
D B MacNiel, rector of St. Paul&#x27;s Church, officiating. Interment in the city cemetery. The
pallbearers were: H G Niles, John Uline, John Tromp, Chas. Sandiands, and A Gaylor.
Adjutant General and wife Mrs. J K Gore, Indianapolis; W W Ferris, Mendon, MI; and
Mr. &amp; Mrs. A L Osborne and son Lawrence, Laporte: and numerous relatives and friends
from out of the city attended the obsequies.
NOTE: There is no history of a town named Hentz in Cayuga County, NY, which this,
and many other articles regarding Nelson Ferris, list as his birthplace. There is, however,
a town in Cayuga County named Mentz, where Nelson&#x27;s father, Leonard Ferris is known
to have lived prior to his move to Galen, Seneca County, NY [which later became
Savannah, Wayne Co., NY] in about 1820. There is also no known town named Pamelia,
NY, where this article alleges Nelson and Sally Weeks Ferris were married most

probably the name of the town is Palmyra, in Wayne County, NY which is located close
to the known Ferris family home in Savannah, NY. The Weeks family was from
Palmyra, NY.
OBIT SALLIE FERRIS SOUTH BEND TRIBUNE [IN]
DECEMBER 2 1912 MRS NELSON FERRIS AGED 100 IS DEAD
Mrs. Nelson Weeks Ferris, aged over 100 years, possibly the oldest woman in St. Joseph
County, and one of the oldest in the United States died this morning at 7 o&#x27;clock. Death
came peacefully at the home of her grand daughter, Mrs. Walter E Roe, 913 Second
Street, as a result of old age. She was ill but four days and bedfast but three days. She
retained nearly all of her faculties up to the time of her last illness. On March 20, last,
she celebrated her 100th birthday anniversary and a reception was given for her by her
grand daughter, Mrs. Roe. The aged woman thoroughly enjoyed the affair and received
114 ladies from this city, South Bend, Elkhart, Chicago and Indianapolis. She had seen
this great country improve, has seen the old trail give way to railroads, the old wagons to
street cars, and sailboats to fast steamships, and has seen South Bend and Mishawaka
grow from small towns or villages into large prosperous manufacturing cities. Mrs.
Ferris has been a member of St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church ever since she came to
Mishawaka.
Mrs. Ferris was formerly Miss Sarah Weeks. She born in Watertown, NY, March 20,
1812, the same year that war with England was declared and four years before Indiana
was admitted to statehood. She was then one of a family of six children and is the last
one to pass away. One sister lived to be 90 years old and all the others lived to be 70.
She came here in 1842 and had lived in this vicinity for 69 years. She was married
January 1, 1840 to the late Nelson Ferris. They made the trip to Mishawaka via the great
lakes to Detroit, MI and from there to this city on the overland trail. In 1890, Mr. and
Mrs. Ferris celebrated their golden wedding anniversary. Mr. Ferris passed away on
October 26, 1899. Mrs. Ferris had lived in the Mishawaka and South Bend area the past
69 years. Four children were born to them and but two daughters survive, Mrs. J K Gore,
of Elkhart and Mrs. Andrew L Osborne, Jr., of Laporte. Funeral arrangements have not
been completed but it will be held from the house Wednesday afternoon. Born to them
