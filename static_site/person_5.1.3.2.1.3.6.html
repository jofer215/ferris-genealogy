            <div class="person-text">(5.1.3.2.1.3.6) SAMUEL STUART FERRIS born July 27, 1837 Mianus CT and died August 17, 1900
Brooklyn NY; married May 7, 1861 in New York City, Elvira Matilda Kellogg [dau of Joseph

Lockwood Kellogg] born August 17, 1837/38, Richmond OH and died October 7, 19**. He was a
merchant and a member and Deacon of the Plymouth Church (Congregational) and a republican.
New York Times, June 13, 1899: Historic Plymouth Church, which has taken an active part in so many reform movements,
has taken the lead in another, which has for its object the solution of one of the great problems of the day—the church hat
question. The church hat question is second only to the theatre hat problem in importance. It probably contributes less to the
world’s sum total of internal profanity, because considerations of piety will restrain the average man from swearing in
church, even to himself; but although no statistics of the increase in Sunday liquor selling resulting from the church hat are
obtainable, it is believed that the strain caused by compressing and restraining so great a volume of profanity has driven
many to drink. It was reserved for Plymouth, or rather to its new Choir Master, G. Waring Stebbins, to take a practical step
toward the solution of the problem, although the magnitude of the evil had long been recognized and pointed out in
newspapers by funny men and others. The credit of the idea belongs to Mr. Stebbins, and in carrying it out he has the
assistance of a chosen band of about a dozen of the prettiest girls in Plymouth Church. Some weeks ago, Deacon Samuel S.
Ferris, in a Plymouth prayer meeting, caused a sensation by tackling the crying church hat evil and trying to throw it. He
declared that on Sunday it was possible to hear the Rev. Dr. Hillis, but impossible to see him unless one had been born
lucky. He said that the pressure of public opinion had dorced the big hat out of the theatre, but that it had reappeared in
mammoth proportions in church. He said that the women of Plymouth Church should take the lead in stamping out the evil,
and that they should it by taking off their own hats on the following Sunday. The men in the audience looked gratefully at
Mr. Ferris, but the women did not seem pleased. Sundays came and went, and the Plymouth hat grew larger and larger, till
the top gallery became crowded with men who had fled to that eyrie in order to be able to catch an occasional glimpse of the
eloquent pastor and see how he looked when preaching. Then Mr. Stebbins hit on a practical idea. On Saturday night he
gathered the young women of the choir around him and unfolded his scheme. It was greeted with trills of laughter and little
squeaks of delight, and even with the clapping of gloved hands. “We’ll do it,” they said. On Sunday morning the men of the
choir trooped in together and took seats in the back part of the choir loft. After them came a troop of pretty girls, otherwise
stylishly garbed, but hatless. In Indian file they marched in and ranged themselves in front of the men and in full view of the
congregation. Such a thing had never been seen before in the fifthy-odd years of Plymouth’s history. The women members
stared with surprise, and turned to their escorts to aske what was the reason for the innovation. The men smiled gleefully
and told them. Then they colored up and tried to look on their hymn books or on the floor. But it was useless. They could no
thelp looking at Mr. Stebbin’s object lesson, for it was in the most prominent part of the church, and the more the women
tried to look elsewhere the more their eyes traveled to the twelve or fifteen dainty girls, sitting in hatless beauty right over
the preachers head. They could not take off their hats then-it would have made them conspicuous; but many a man who ha
sat Sunday after Sunday wondering what the pastor of Plymouth Church looks lke in anticipating next Sunday eagerly in
happy expectation that Mr. Stebbin’s object lesson has not been thrown away.
