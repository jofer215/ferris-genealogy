            <div class="person-text">(3.1.1.6.5) EZRA FERRIS, Dr., born April 26, 1782/3 in the parish of Stanwich, Greenwich CT and
died April 10/19, 1857 Lawrenceburg, Dearborn, IN; his family removed from Stanwich CT to Ohio
1789; the first five years he spent at Columbia were during the horrors of the Indian war. He saw the
dejection of the spirits of the pioneers when Harmar&#x27;s expedition failed and St. Clair was disastrously
defeated, and participated in the rejoicing over Wayne&#x27;s victory. Referring to the settlers, he says,
“Many of them had been raised in opulence and had indulged in luxuries and enjoyed all the necessities
of life, now removed far from their former homes, where nothing but the most common fare could be
had and that often in stinted measure, were cast down though not forsaken. Add to the want of bread,
the mortification an American mother (who had been at all times in the habit of clothing her children
comfortably, and sometimes ornamenting them to please her fancy), must feel to see them clad in rags
and dirt, for the want of materials to make new clothes of, or soap to wash them when dirty, and you
will see enough to discourage and distress them”. Ezra had the benefit of such schools as could be
supported at Columbia during the Indian War, and after the return of peace, obtained a good education.
When a young man he studied in a good school in one of the Eastern States, and his education was
quite a liberal one for the son of an early western emigrant. When quite a young man he was licensed as
a Baptist preacher at the Duck Creek Baptist Church and was afterward ordained. He taught school at
Lebanon OH, and studied medicine while teaching. Later moving to Lawrenceburg IN, he practiced
medicine, preached to the destitute Baptist Churches of that area and established a drug store. He was
active in the Baptist Church and in public affairs. As a member of the Dearborn County delegation,
1816, to the Constitutional Convention when Indiana became a state, he was chairman of the
committee on elective franchise and elections. He was elected to the State Senate, from Dearborn
County, 1816, a position he apparently held for several years, during which he was one of the censors
for the licensing of physicians. At the request of the editor of the Independent Press, he wrote a series
of letters for the newspaper, giving an account of the settlement of Cincinnati and Columbia and
depicting the early days there. These letters were reprinted in the first volume of the Publications of
the Indiana Historical Society, of which Dr. Ezra Ferris was one of the founders and a charter member.
Before he became an old man he retired from the active practice of medicine but continued his drug
store. He also continued to preach at Lawrenceburg and at Salem. “Dr. Ferris was a most useful man.
He was modest and retiring, but highly respected by all. He was strongly attached to his own branch of
the church and was a sincere and deeply pious man. In politics he was a Whig. He was a man of fixed
principles and his friends always knew where to find him”. He married 1st December 5, 1804
Catherine Thornell and 2d November 6, 1847 Amanda Abbott; and born to Ezra and Catherine were:</div>
