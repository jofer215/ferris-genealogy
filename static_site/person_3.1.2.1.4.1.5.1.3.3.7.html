            <div class="person-text">(3.1.2.1.4.1.5.1.3.3.7) ARCHIE WARREN MCGREGOR born October 5, 1913 Old McGregor Ranch
on Cedar River ND and died August 9, 1971 Staples, Todd, MN; buried there; his folks homesteaded in
western North Dakota in 1896, and his mother spent 11 consecutive years on the ranch without getting
into the nearest town, Mandan, 75 miles away. The McGregor family worked hard at their business,
and it soon grew into a 5,220-acre cattle and horse ranch. His Dad didn’t hire any men – the kids did it
all – and one day when Archie was only 8y, he was harnessing a team of work horses. One of the
animals stepped on his bare foot and the extreme weight necessitated remove of one of Archie’s little
toes. He worked with cattle, horses and sheep until he was 41y, then became sheriff of Sioux County
ND for 4y before becoming New Salem’s police chief for a year. He served on a Linchol School district
board for 6y and on the Cedar Soil Conservation District for 14y – Governor William Guy cited him for
his conservation work. He and 4 of his kids once had a 5-piece band – Archie played the violin – they
played for North Dakota basket socials and house parties – ‘that was the only entertainment in the
area’, he said. Archie was Deadwood’s assistant police chief – he owned an 800-acre farm in North
Dakota. He married October 24, 1931 in Seldfridge ND, Anne Marie Rowell [dau of Samuel LeRoy &amp;

Mary Margaret (Breiner) Rowell] born September 19, 1912 Shields ND and died February 3, 2000
Staples MN; and they had 10 kids – an “apparent” grandson: Archie Warren McGregor II, age 42 of
Custer formerly of Broadus. Vistation will be on July 2, 2003 at the First Baptist Church in Broadus.
Funeral services will be July 3, 2003 in the First Baptist Church; burial will be in the Valley View
Cemetery, Broadus.</div>
