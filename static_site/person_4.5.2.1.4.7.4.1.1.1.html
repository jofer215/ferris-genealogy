There are many people who have an influence on our lives. One such individual who had a great influence on many lives
was Marvin Forkner. He was not the type to seek recognition, yet he had many accomplishments and a great amount of
influence on others. He made the transition from this life into another dimension last Thursday after 88 years in this life
experience. His funeral was held at the Rinehart Christian Church on Monday. It has been a great pleasure to have
associated with him during the years. I knew that he had a major role in some of the programs with which I was involved.
Through hearing the obituary and the elegies given of him, I learned that his influence was much greater than I had realized.
I classified him as being a salt- of-the-earth person. One tribute that the Reverend Lennie McCoy gave him was that he was
a pillar of the community, of his church and his family. Certainly, he could be described as a pillar. The Rev. Gary Reed had
told me at the family visitation that if he was going to pick a father for himself, other than his own father, it would have
been Marvin. He said so again during the funeral service. He was a successful farmer and livestock man. He also served on
several boards and volunteered his services on many projects. I wonder how he could do all of the things that he did in life.
He was a good organizer and had a strong work ethic. Yet Marvin had time for fun, his family, his church and his
community. His influence extended out to other countries. Someone commented at the funeral that many things have been
said about Marvin in the past few days. I can only relate to you some of the experiences that I had with him. He was
chairman of the County Extension Council back in the &#x27;60s and provided good leadership to the council in some decisions
that had to be made at that time. He served on the steering committee for the McGinnis Youth Center, as discussion was
being held about the possibilities of the youth center and a donation of l60 acres of land that Mary McGinnis was
considering giving to the youth in this area. According to my memory which may not be worth much), he was chairman of
the steering committee that established the Mary A. McGinnis Agricultural Park and Youth Center, Inc. This took a great
amount of effort. After the board was organized he served as its first president and served in this position for several years.
He volunteered a great amount of time to the center and did many things for the center. On one occasion, Marvin and I took
his truck to the Veterans Administration Hospital to haul back surplus mattresses that we stored in the hayloft of the barn at
the center -- on a fairly warm day. That was an enjoyable experience. As our country remembers the assassination of
President John Kennedy that occurred 40 years ago, many of us can remember what we were doing that day -- here&#x27;s a
memory of Marvin on that historic day, During the afternoon, Marvin came to the extension office and that tragedy was on
our minds. The Reverend Piney Elliot was serving the First Christian Church at that time and it was announced over the
radio that the church was open for people to use for prayer. Marvin and I went over there together for moments of prayer.
Marvin served on the youth fair board for a number of years and gave leadership to committees and supported the fair in
several ways. He was handy and could do many things. When the livestock pavilion was being built, I was on top
attempting to work on the new construction. Marvin was there, too, and he got much more done than I was doing. I have a

fear of heights -- when I stand up, I am almost too high. While the building is not very high, I was still moving with caution.
Marvin did not have any trouble getting around on top of the building and he was laughing with me, at my fears. The
Forkners, as a family, were actively involved with 4-H. One year Marvin and Gladys Helen applied to be host to an
International Four-H Youth Exchange delegate. They hosted a girl from England, which provided a good experience for the
delegate, for the family, and many others in the area. The delegate learned about life on a Missouri farm and we learned
more about life in her country. This developed into a lifetime friendship between the Forkners and the delegate. It was
always a pleasure to be at their farm. Many readers, especially from that area, will remember the water they had from their
drilled well. The water contained sulfur and many would not have considered it good drinking water, but it was like the well
we had at our farm when I was growing up, so it made me feel at home. Marvin liked to hunt and he was a good hunter.
One time I went hunting with him, George Graham, and others. Someone had loaned me a gun. Of course, the birds were
safe with my shots. Marvin laughed with me about my shooting, too. It was mentioned during the funeral that several
enjoyed the meals there at the Forkner home and the good food that Gladys Helen served. I also had that good experience on
different occasions. One of the things I remember about Marvin and Gladys Helen was when they went to Africa to visit
their daughter, Helen, and her husband Zion Nutt, while they were serving as missionaries. Zion told what Marvin had done
while he was there and that his actions as a missionary still have an influence on those people. He also told about a number
of other ways that Marvin had influenced people in other countries. Yes, there is much more that could be said about this
special individual. Possibly the greatest tribute to him is the influence he had on his children, which contributed to their
successes and contributions they have made in life. Marvin&#x27;s life was a testimony to his faith. The world is better off as
result of his life experiences. Deepest sympathy is expressed to his family. Goodbye Marvin, thank you for what you did
and for being a good role model for me and many others.</div>
