            <div class="person-text">(3.1.6.8.5) SAMUEL ROSE III born January 5, 1774 Manchester, Bennington, VT and died April 4,
1825 Wolford Township, Grenville, Ontario; married December 24, 1799 in Montague Township,
Lanark Co, Ontario, Charlotte McIntyre/McIntire [dau of Jesse &amp; Martha (Lamb) McIntyre] born
March 26, 1780 Charlton, Worchester, MA and died January 4, 1851 Wolford Township, Grenville Co.
After their marriage, they lived in Montague Township, which was part of Wolford at the time. Their
area became known as Roseville or Rosedale. They were isolated in the forest. In 1813, they moved to
a farm on Irish Creek (also in Wolford), close to Charlotte&#x27;s sister, Chloe Brown. Samuel and Samuel
IV, both fought on the St. Lawrence Front in the winter of 1813-14. Samuel farmed and had a stopping
house. The year, 1816, was the year of no summer, when there was so much volcanic fallout in the air
that the weather never warmed up and crops failed. In 1817, Samuel was a Lieutenant Colonel in
Burritt&#x27;s Grenville Militia. More settlers moved into the area as the Canal was built. A religious revival
was sweeping North America, and with the unexpected death of his eldest son in 1820, Samuel took the
pledge of Temperance, but he still had a license to sell it. He donated land for a church and supported
the building of a school close to the cemetery at Wolford of the Rideau. After Samuel&#x27;s death,
Charlotte moved in with their son Hugh. [Information has been provided and withdrawn on this twig of
