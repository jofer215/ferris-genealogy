            <div class="person-text">(3.1.1.6.3.11) ALFRED EARLE, Rev., M.D., born July 10, 1813 at the family residence at South
Street, Oyster Bay NY and died October 18, 1881 Philadelphia PA; educated at the Academy, of which
his father was Principal, and taught school when a young man. As long as he lived he retained a

fondness for the schoolroom, and at different periods of his life he joined the work of a pedagogue with
his other professional employments. It was while teaching school at Babylon, Long Island, in his
twenty-first year that he was converted. He immediately came home and applied for admission to the
church. He was baptized on the 8th of December 1833, and on Christmas of the same year he began to
preach, laboring for the conversion of souls in the vicinity of the village. These efforts were attended
with such success that many were converted during the two years following, among them being his
next older brother, Samuel, with his wife Phoebe. Thus began a ministry that terminated only with his
life, and that was characterized by the same earnestness and zeal manifested in the first months of his
religious life. He was licensed to preach on February 9, 1834 and for the next forty-eight years labored
incessantly in the ministry, having his greatest success and finding his greatest pleasure in the work of
evangelism, for which he was peculiarly fitted. Alfred was of a roving disposition and lived or preached
in several places, to include Hopewell NJ, Salem County NJ, Wilmington DE. Bucks County PA;
Steuben County NY, Rockland County NY, Camden NJ, Riceville PA, Cambridge OH, Lawrenceburg
IN, Moore&#x27;s Hill IN, Pierceville IN, Johnsonville PA and finally Philadelphia. It was while at the
Southampton Baptist Church of Bucks County, that he received a diploma from the Jefferson Medical
College of Philadelphia, and began the practice of medicine, in connection with his ministerial labors.
After a pastorate at Southampton of four and a half years, Dr. Earle terminated his connection with that
church and removed to Philadelphia, where he opened a drug store. After he withdrew from the
pastorate of the Southampton Church, thirty-three members seceded and in March 1849, formed the
Davisville Baptist Church. Dr. Earle was engaged to supply the new organization, walking from
Philadelphia to Davisville on Sunday mornings, a distance of about seventeen miles, and returning by
stage during the week. Davisville became more like home than any other spot. He was tall and
commanding in stature, with a strong countenance full of character and a flashing eye, with the voice of
an orator, vibrant with passion, his platform presence was very impressive, and gave weight to what he
said. He married March 29, 1835 at Oyster Bay, Priscilla McCoun (Lockwood) Hegans born April 3,
1817 Oyster Bay and died December 14, 1888 Philadelphia PA; both buried at Davisville Baptist
Church Cemetery, Davisville, Bucks, PA (Photos); and born to them were [in addition to the below
there were four others, unnamed]:</div>
