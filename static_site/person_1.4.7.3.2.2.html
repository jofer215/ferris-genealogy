            <div class="person-text">(1.4.7.3.2.2) ROBERT LIVINGSTON PELL (1st born?) born May 10, 1811 and died
February 13, 1880; graduated from Harvard and made the Grand Tour of Europe;
married 1837 Maria Louisa Brinckerhoff [dau of James Lefferts &amp; Charlotte (Troup)
Brinckerhoff] born c1817 NYC; they moved from NYC to the Espous property where he
built a brick house in the then popular Tuscan Revival style of a Roman villa, described
by one visitor as “Greek without and Roman within”. It was 70 feet square. The dining
room, 28 feet long, was hung with pictures which were copies of masterpieces of Italian
painting. Around this mansion lay the productive and landscaped acres of Pelham Farm,
which was among the wonders of its day because of its orchards, its vineyards, its three
fishponds, its wharves from which Pelham Farm apples were shipped to Europe and
even to China. He is said to have had 25,000 apple trees. His specialty was the Yellow
Newtown Pippin apple, a long-keeping apple largely exported and known in England by
the time of the American Revolution. In the mid-1840s, Pell built a dock on the river
with a large stone warehouse, where his apples were sweated to prepare them for their
European journeys. It is said that they lasted nine months with this treatment. The
Hudson By Daylight Map of 1878 shows the estate of Robert Pell on the west side of the
Hudson south of Esopus Village. The map states that Pell’s farm was 1200 acres. His
residence was located north of Esopus Village. The recession of 1857 hit Robert hard;
and the Civil War ruined his apple export business. He was forced to sell his holdings. In
1869, he sold his holdings to his son-in-law, John B Ireland, who 35 years later sold a
major portion to the Redemptorist Fathers (Mount St Alphonsus). Born to them were:</div>
