            <div class="person-text">(5.1.1.3.5.1.4) THEODORE ISAAC FERRIS born May 24, 1847, Greenwich and died December 22,
1933 Stamford CT; bachelor; attended the district school in the Simsbury district of Stamford and the
Stamford high school. These courses were supplemented by a few terms at the Glendenning Academy.
Theodore stayed at the homestead and engaged in farming on an extensive scale. As the surrounding
country grew, and houses were built more closely together, he became interested in real estate. With
his brother, Silas, he laid out Woodside Park, building attractive driveways and approaches. A halfmile racetrack was built. His residence with its spacious grounds was a location unexcelled in

Stamford, where Ferris’ have lived since early Colonial days. Although Theodore never took an active
part in municipal affairs, he had that interest which is at the heart of every good citizen. [From Bill
Slagle, 1997 - These stories come first-hand from my mother and her younger sister, both of whom
knew Theodore Isaac to speak to. As I wrote before, my mother was 19 when he died 1933, and my
aunt was 14. Theodore Isaac Ferris was a tall, thin Ichabod Crane-like eccentric. He would walk into
town from his home on Bedford Street to buy day-old bread to save a penny and to read the newspaper
at the public library. He would speak to little girls, but he did not like the little boys because they made
fun of him. Eccentric he may have been, but he was no fool; when he died, they found money in the
mattresses and money in the walls. He was a millionaire in cash and property! He owned all the land
on Summer Street where the Ridgeway Shopping Center now stands (when my parents were children,
the circus used to set up their tents there.) and the King School, a private boy’s school leased their
playing fields from him.] Theodore sold Halloween (now Cummings) Park, in 1927, for $300,000.
This property is a beachfront park on Long Island Sound.</div>
