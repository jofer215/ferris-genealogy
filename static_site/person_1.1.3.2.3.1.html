            <div class="person-text">(1.1.3.2.3.1) WASHINGTON K. FERRIS (Washington Knapp?) (c1820-) married
1st February 18, 1847 Prudence Sayre; buried Sandstone Cemetery, Calhoun Co MI; and
2d 1851 Catherine McClellan. He enlisted in Company E, 3d Infantry May 13, 1861 at
Grand Rapids MI for 3 years. At the age of 41 years, he was discharged for disability,
but re-entered the service in Company D, 3d Infantry at reorganization, as Captain, age
44, July 29, 1864. There is a Washington Ferris buried at the Riverside Cemetery, Barry
County MI who died January 7, 1892 at age 72 years – might be this guy. One source
has daughters named Viola, Ceola, and Mary – are these his daughters from either
marriage or daughters brought to the 2d marriage? Same source has Washington as a
saloon owner in the Arizona Territory 1870; 1883 he applied for Civil War pension and
in 1890 he is back in Rutland, Barry, MI on the Veterans Schedule</div>
