From Rockford Register, Wednesday, April 1, 1903, page 3:
A Very Sad Tragedy
A very sad tragedy occurred at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Whittall, six miles West of Rockford, in Algoma
Township, last Friday. It seems that Clyde and Arthur Whittall, aged 24 and 22 years, got into a quarrel while working down
in the woods regarding a dog, and finally words led to blows. Arthur, although younger, was the taller and stronger of the
two, and gave Clyde a severe drubbing. As soon as he could get away Clyde started for the house - Arthur, thinking that
Clyde was after a gun, also went to the house, Clyde going the front way and Arthur the back way. Arthur secured the gun
and was coming towards Clyde, and the latter, thinking that he meant to kill him, picked up a butcher knife that lay on the
table and Clyde says that he told him to keep back, but that he jumped at him and he then struck him with the knife which
entered his breast four inches and pierced his left lung. Their mother was the only one to see the aweful deed done, which
was done so quickly that she was powerless to prevent it. This happened about noon, and although everything possible was
done yet he passed away about 7 o&#x27;clock that evening. Before he died, however, Arthur made a statement in the presence of
witnesses, exonerating Clyde from all blame, saying, &quot;Don&#x27;t have him arrested for I am to blame for it all. It was not his
fault - he thought I was going to kill him.&quot; Arthur remained conscious to the last, and his last words were those which he
hoped would clear his brother. Sheriff Chapman was notified and dispatched officers, Greenley and Verkerke to take Clyde
into custody. The latter never left the house after the stabbing, and upon arrival of the officers gave himself up to them at
once. Owing to the sever injuries received at the hands of his brother, both eyes being blackened and nearly swollen shut,
his ears lacerated and discolored, it was deemed advisable to not take him to Grand Rapids until morning, he being brought
to Rockford and taking the 10:44am train. An inquest was held Saturday in charge of Justice Beeby, of Sparta, taking the
testimony of the attending physician and several neighbors who heard the last words of the deceased. The jury promptly
brought a verdict that said Arthur Whittall came to his death from a wound inflicted with a butcher knife in the hand of his
brother, Clyde, who acted in self defense. The funeral services for the deceased young man were held at the Morningstar
school house Monday afternoon, Rev. J. H. Maynard, of Sparta, officiating, and was very largely attended by relatives,
friends and neighbors, who deeply sympathize with the family in their terribly sad bereavement. Clyde Whittall was
arrainged at Grand Rapids yesterday afternoon. His examination was set for April 10, and he was released on $5,000 bail.
The bondsmen are: H. A. Montgomery, T. H. Whittall, Wm. Whittall, Edward Whittall, C. F. Chapman and Jas. H. Parmeter.</div>
