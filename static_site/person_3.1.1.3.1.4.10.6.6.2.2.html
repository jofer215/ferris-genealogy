Falls VT; baptized December 1969, Congregational Church, Plainfield NH; graduated from Groton
School 1981; She has been given a task to endure that none of us would envy. When we found out that
Grady was deaf, we all shed tears and tore our hair out trying to figure out why. Carie quickly went
beyond the questions and instead persistently and diligently pursued her and his options in order to find
solutions. She not only finds the track for him, she, at the same time, sees to it that Charlie and Hunter
are challenged in accordance with their abilities. Carol married June 18, 1983 at Groton MA, Peter
Hedden Congleton born October 8, 1959 at Ayer, Middlesex, MA; a fundraiser. Before moving to
Groton in the summer of 1994, Carol and her family lived in Deerfield MA, the town of her ancestors,
Daniel and Elizabeth (Foote) Belden, and Benjamin and Sarah (Belden) Burt, the captives. Carie
joined the faculty at Groton School in September, 1994 where she became head of a dormitory of 17
girls ages about 14-18; in 1996, that headcount grew to 40 girls. She quickly gained a reputation for
strictness and fairness with warmth and a wonderful sense of humor. Her extraordinary culinary skills
have become well known through her &#x27;dorm feeds&#x27;. Peter graduated Groton School, 1978; Wesleyan,
1982. He served in the U.S. Navy, 1983-88 and the Navy Reserve, 1988-94; Lieutenant Commander,
