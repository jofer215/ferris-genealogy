– thanks. Bob! Bob’s personal memories of his father: “Dad was a soft-spoken, hard working
Viriginian who moved u p to Pennsylanvia where Mom was from and Ohio to find better working
conditions-as a millwright in the steel mills of Youngstown OH. He grew up in relatively poor
economic family conditions in Virginia (he enjoyed the Waltons TV show of Virginia, but thought they
were rich compared to his upbringing). His family-my aunts, uncles, and cousins; I didn’t know myi
Nay grandparents-always seemed to have an extra closeness and togetherness among them. I always
and still do enjoy visits with them and especially trips to Batesville VA. I remember Dad working all
three shifts at the steel mills and the coke/coal smell that would come home on his clothes. He also
worked a second job in an appliance store installing and repairing appliances. He enjoyed country
music (especially his brother Bee singing and playing guitar); enjoyed our sports playing when he
could watch; enjoyed his grandchildren; enjoyed his family; and enjoyed helping others. Everybody
loved Jake.”</div>
