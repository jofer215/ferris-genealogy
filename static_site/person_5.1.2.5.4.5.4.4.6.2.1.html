            <div class="person-text">(5.1.2.5.4.5.4.4.6.2.1) STEVEN JAMES BALES born January 30, 1959 St Louis MO and died 1995;
from his sister, Gail: “I love your website. After looking over it last weekend, I realized where my late
brother Steve got his engineering genius. When we were growing up he was always taking things apart
and trying to build something new. After high school, he went into the Army where he worked on
helicopters, and then, while on weekend leave, he was in a horrible accident and suffered a serious
brain injury. After getting a medical discharge, he went on to seven different universities and colleges,
but he could never pass the calculus tests, and he finally gave up trying to get an engineering degree.
But I think you can see where I’m going with this – it took a catastrophic injury to stop him. I think he
got a fair share of those Ferris genes!”</div>
