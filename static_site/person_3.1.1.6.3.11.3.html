            <div class="person-text">(3.1.1.6.3.11.3) FRANCIS MARION EARLE, Rev., born July 5, 1841 Beezeleys Neck, Lower
Alloway Creek, Salem Co NJ and died November 16, 1916 Philadelphia PA. His boyhood, up to the
age of sixteen, was spent in the vicinity of Davisville PA. In 1857 he went with his parents to Hornby
NY and for a while attended a school at Elmira NY; he worked in his father&#x27;s store in Piermont NY; at
the outbreak of the Civil War he was living in Jersey City NJ, where he learned the trade of carpenter;
1862 when he became of age, he enlisted in Company B., 13th Regiment, New Jersey Volunteers; his
Regiment left Newark for the seat of war on August 31, 1862 and seventeen days later were in the thick
of the fight at Antietam; followed Chancellorsville and Gettysburg, where the Regiment saw hard
fighting; after the last named engagement, Slocum&#x27;s Corps, to which the 13th belonged, was transferred
to the Army of the Cumberland, and Mr. Earle went with Sherman on his March to the Seal was in the
War till its close; on being mustered out of service, he settled in Philadelphia, where he spent the
remainder of his life. He was first associated with his brother-in-law, Mr. T. B. M. Addis, in the flour
and feed business. Later he went in business for himself, first on Otis Street, then on Frankford
Avenue. But during the latter part of his life, for more than thirty years, he was employed in the
Philadelphia Post Office, mostly as a carrier. Mr. Earle was converted while in the Army, and at once
became active in religious work. Connecting himself with the Mount Zion Baptist Church, on
Frankford Avenue, he was made superintendent of the Sunday school, in which capacity he served for
many years, both there, and afterwards, in the Messiah Baptist Church on Dauphin Street. He also
engaged in street preaching and the work of organizing new Sunday Schools. Several of the Baptist
churches in Philadelphia grew out of interests begun in this way, notably the Fiftieth, the Allegheny
Avenue, the Fairhill, and the Wissinoming Avenue. Some of these look upon Mr. Earle was their
founder or, at least, as largely instrumental in their coming into being. Mr. Earle also conducted the
Waterloo Street Mission for several years, holding meetings every night for a very extended period.
Yielding to the persuasion of his friends, Mr. Earle was ordained to the Christian ministry, but he never
ceased his secular occupation. For seven years he served the Wissinoming Baptist Church as pastor,
engaging daily in his work as letter carrier. On August 21, 1862, before his Regiment left for
Washington, Mr. Earle married, at Jersey City NJ, Susannah Suarez born October 11, 1840, near
Havana, Cuba. Born to them were:</div>
