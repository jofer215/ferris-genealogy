Stratford CT (baptized March 12, 1744) and died 1816 Greenwich. He graduated from Yale College
1765. Samuel was an ensign (surgeon mate) in Captain Hoit&#x27;s Company (5th Regiment), serving in
New York in April 1775; he was commissioned a second lieutenant 15 March 1777 in Colonel Lamb&#x27;s
Artillery and was taken prisoner in Colonel Webb&#x27;s Expedition to Long Island (White Plains),
December 10, 1777 and was imprisoned on the ship Jersey. Samuel received a vote of thanks from the
Congress for his medical care of the prisoners. He was exchanged and resigned 14 March 1781. He
graduated from Yale in 1765. The oldest son of Abigail and Samuel bought an old house called the
Peck Place at Mianus (Riverside) CT, later owned by Vanderbilt Buxton and called the Buxton Place.
Dr. Whiting died there. The son, Samuel Ferris Whiting, gave his mother a life lease. Abigail lived
there until a short time before her death. Her son, Robert Morris Whiting took her to his home in
Brooklyn, where she lived just a short time before she died on New Years Day 1836. Abigail was the
first person buried in the Sound Beach Cemetery. ‘She was handsome and well-to-do, but her uncle

Ebenezer Ferris, who was her guardian spent her money’ and built two churches. Born to Abigail and
Samuel were (probably not in birth sequence):</div>
