            <div class="person-text">(3.10.1.2.8.1.1.8.3) CHARLES WESLEY GRANSBURY born April 4, 1879 Sterling, Rice, KS and
died January 19, 1971 Burley, Cassia, ID; buried Paul Cemetery, Paul, Minidoka, ID (Photo) – Life
Sketch given at his funeral: “The Gransbury family lived on the county line between Rice and Reno
Counties in the state of Kansas, where they operated a farm which they had homesteaded in 1878. It
was here that young Charles spent his early childhood. Charles attended school in Rice County until he
had completed most of the fourth grade. At that time, his father needed his help with the farm work and
his formal education gave way to the demands of every day life. The family continued in this endeavor
until Charles was 18 years of age. About that time, William Harper from Albion, Idaho, a missionary
for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints entered their lives. In March of 1897, his Mother
and Father joined the Church with his two sisters joining shortly after. At that particular time in history,
Kansas was not a pleasant place to live if you were a Mormon, so in fall of 1897, the family moved to
Albion, Idaho. The trek consumed nine weeks and four days. During the journey, one of their best
horses was struck by a rattlesnake. This caused a delay of some four days while arrangements were
made for another horse. Charles met Jennie Louis Parrott on April 4, 1990. This mortal acquaintance
lasted some 65 years. They were married January 30, 1901. This marital union was blessd with six
children five sons, Orval Howard, Walter Charles, George Wesley, William Leslie, and Charles Marion,
and one daughter, Eunice Naomi. Of these six children four of the sons preceded Charles in death. They
had one son die when he was born early. He was never named. Charles Marion being the surviving son.
His wife, Jennie Louise Parrott, [dau of William Edward &amp; Christiana Kitty (Stevens) Parrott] also
preceded him in death, passing away in May 1965 (May 16, 1965 Burley ID, buried with Charles).
However, this good sister lived to see her fondest dream fulfilled as Charles joined the Church on June
30, 1962 and then he took his bride of 61 years to the Temple in Idaho Falls to have their marriage
sealed for Time and Eternity on February 12, 1964. On March 22, 1968 at age 87, Charles married
Mary Ransom (Sant) and they shared the remaining years of his life. Charles Wesley Gransbury lived a
long and eventful life. He was a farmer, rancher, liveryman, and freight hauler. He was a resident of this
area for nearly 74 years. He is survived by his wife, Mary, two sisters, a son, Charles Marlon, and a
daughter, Eunice Naomi William, 24 grandchildren, 85 great-grandchildren, and 11 great-great
grandchildren.” Born to him and Jennie were:</div>
