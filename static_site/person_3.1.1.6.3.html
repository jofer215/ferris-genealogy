            <div class="person-text">(3.1.1.6.3) MARY FERRIS (AFN: 8RLM-GQ) born June 1, 1769 Stamford CT and died June 25,
1832 Oyster Bay, Nassau, Long Island NY. When Mary&#x27;s father migrated to Ohio, she remained in
Stamford with her Uncle Ebenezer and it was there she met her husband; was married by her Uncle
Ebenezer April 22, 1792 at Stamford, Rev. Marmaduke Earle born March 21, 1769 New York City and
died July 13, 1856 Oyster Bay NY; in accordance with the faith of his father, Marmaduke was
presented in St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church for baptism; converted to the Dutch Reformed Church {his
mother&#x27;s church} 1785 and entered the Latin Grammar School and began the study of the classics.
After a brief preparatory study of Latin and Greek, he was accepted at Kings College (Columbia),
graduating 1790 and receiving his Master degree 1793. It was after this that he connected himself with
the Baptist Church of Scotch Plains, from which he received a license to preach. He accepted a call
from the Baptist Church of Stamford CT, June 7, 1791, to settle with them and provide assistance to the
Rev. Ebenezer Ferris. Mr. Earle resided in Stamford for a period of ten years, not only serving as
pastor, but also engaging in the work of teaching, for which he was peculiarly fitted. In 1801, the
trustees of the Oyster Bay Academy invited Mr. Earle to take charge of this literary institution, which
under construction. “I accepted the invitation and entered into a contract with them. Accordingly, in the
month of April, the ensuing year, I removed my family to Oyster Bay, Long Island. I opened the
Academy for the reception of pupils on the 12th day of April, 1802&quot;. At the same time, the Baptist
Church in Oyster Bay invited Mr. Earle to become their pastor. He accepted that invitation, and on the
5th of April 1802, began to preach stately in the old meetinghouse. His work as an educator continued
until 1843, at the age of seventy-four, he relinquished active labors in that line. His children were
educated in the Academy, under their father&#x27;s tuition, and some of them continued for many years his
educational work, after he stepped out of the harness. He continued with his ministry till his death in
1856, a period of fifty-four years. Born to them were [LDS has Mary&#x27;s spouse as Earle Marmaduke
