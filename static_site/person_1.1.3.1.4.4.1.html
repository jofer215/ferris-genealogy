            <div class="person-text">(1.1.3.1.4.4.1) ARTHUR WELLINGTON ADAMS, M.D., born June 21, 1856 Brooklyn
NY and died December 19, 1898, St. Louis MO, of double pneumonia; buried
Bellefontaine Cemetery; married March 5, 1884 in St. Louis, Suzanne Slayback [dau. of
Colonel Alonzo &amp; Alice (Waddell) Slayback] born 1860 and died September 16, 1935;
buried with Arthur (cemetery and headstone photo). Dr. Adams &#x27;was a genius born way
before this time&#x27;; graduate of Medical School, Georgetown University 1876; had curly
hair, light-colored eyes, and a cleft in his chin and was very handsome and charismatic;
invented important electrical equipment for use in medicine: the otoscope; laryngoscope;
and many cauterizing tools, but suffered from patent infringement. He owned Adams
Electric Company in St. Louis. {See a biography of Dr. Adams, written by Thomas
Bullard, 1988, in the Chicago Transit Authority Library.} Suzanne born six months after
the Pony Express Rider left St. Joseph MO; her parents being present when the historic
rider left for Sacramento CA. Suzanne spent at least the first six years of her life living
with her grandparents, William Bradford &amp; Susan C. (Byram) Waddell)[this William
Waddell was partners with Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell and owned the Overland Express,
Pikes Peak and Overland Stage that went to Denver and the famous Pony Express] as
her mother spent the duration of the Civil War in banishment for having crossed the
southern lines to be with her husband and nurse him through typhoid fever and had to
wait out the duration of the War before she could return. Colonel Slayback was the
commander of the Missouri Cavalry Battalion in General Shelby&#x27;s Division and as
described by General Shelby, &quot;Colonel Slayback won for himself a name and reputation
for daring and gallantry that has no superior&quot;. Colonel Slayback chose exile in Mexico,
with General Shelby, rather than live under Northern rule. Alonzo eventually returned
home, but while in Mexico he wrote many poems to his wife. Alonzo was an attorney
and had a practice in St. Louis - in 1882 (he had red hair and a fiery temper), he went to
the office of the St. Louis Post Dispatch to take it up with the managing editor the fact
that he printed lies in the newspaper owned by none other than Joseph Pulitzer and the
Editor (Cockerill), shot Alonzo dead. Nothing was ever done to Cockerill and he lied
and claimed it was self-defense. The controversy over that death still rages today,
especially within this family. Suzanne&#x27;s mother turned the house into a two family
dwelling sometime after Alonzo was murdered. The story goes that she rented out half of

the house to Dr. Adams and his widowed mother, and that is how Suzanne came to know
her future husband. Suzanne was the first Queen of the Veiled Prophets Ball in St. Louis
MO. Like her mother before her, she was left with six small children to raise and at one
point had to put four of them in an orphanage because she couldn&#x27;t care for all of them.
Even though two of her daughters spent time in an orphanage they revered their heritage
and studied long hours to discover many ancestors. Dorothy and Marie were the true
genealogists of the family. Born to them were:</div>
