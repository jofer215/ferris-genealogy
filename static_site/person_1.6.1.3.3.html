Underhill Genealogy, 1932
FROM THE MANUSCRIPT OF ABRAHAM S UNDERHILL. Conversation that
Abraham S Underhill and Abraham I Underhill had. Memoranda of conversation with
Abraham I Underhill in which he gave some account of the Underhill family (of his own
times) from recollection:
My father (Isaac Underhill) was born on his father’s (Abraham) farm situated near
White Plains, Westchester County, N.Y. (Yorktown NY). He was a man of great bodily
strength and sound constitution. He was very industrious, even to old age, say, over 80.
During he life he partly cleared up three farms near Saw Mill River, Nanahagan or
Phillips Manor, now the town of Mount Pleasant. He was a man of good natural ability,
but little improved by education, yet was a man of good judgment and was an elder of
the Society of Friends for many years. His father (Abraham Underhill) lived at White
Plains. Before father left White Plains he partly cleared the farms of his brothers Jacob

and Abraham at Nanahagan, he going back and forwards by a footpath, which was the
only road between the two places. The neighborhood was then inhabited by Indians and
wild animals. He moved to Nanahagan about 1738, at which time the Indians had not yet
left the neighborhood. He moved to Amawalk (Yorktown) in 1774. The Amawalk farm
was cleared when he bought it, and was one of the first farms cleared in that part of the
country.
During the Revolutionary War Washington’s main army on its way from White
Plains to New Jersey marched past the house, going from Pines Bridge to Peekskill. I
frequently saw Washington pass during the time, so I knew as well as I did anybody. He
always had a lifeguard of twelve young gentlemen riding before him with drawn swords
for protection and honor. They were said to be Virginians. I recollect perfectly well
meeting him by the schoolhouse near Parker’s and at another time a little south of the
old Amawalk Meeting House, and also when he passed our house the two former times
he was not with the Army. When I saw him pass our house it was when he proclaimed
that he intended to take New York, and was making every exertion to collect men and
stores for that purpose, but his real intention was to divert the British in New York to
prevent their sending forces to Yorktown, Virginia, to relieve Lord Cornwallis.
Washington went down as far as White Plains and then commenced forced marches to
West Point, and so through New Jersey south to Yorktown, Virginia, and succeeded in
capturing Cornwallis and all his army before he could be relieved from New York. A
sergeant’s guard was kept at our house almost during all the war.
Major Andre with lawyer Smith of Orange County, N.Y., called at my father’s the
day he was taken, at about 8 o’clock in the morning; they wanted breakfast. Andre was
on his way from West Point to New York and made many inquiries respecting the road.
His mind appeared to be very much impressed, so that he could not be still a moment.
Smith ate breakfast which mother prepared for him, but Andre appeared very agitated,
walked backwards and forwards before the front door, and ate nothing. He had on a blue
light-bodied coat, made plain after the fashion of the New England farmers of the day.
The New England farmers, having manufactories, wore good clothes, but those of this
part of the country were unable to obtain good clothes, not having any fulling mills or
manufactories. Smith went back north from our house and Andre went towards New
York alone. He went by the way of Pines Bridge and Tarrytown. Near the latter place he
was taken prisoner by Van Wart and others who were out on a scouting party.
In the time of the Revoluntion the British Light Horse came through this part of
the country. They came from Crumpond to our house. They burned several houses,
killed one or more men and wounded every man they met, taking them off prisoners to

New York; they robbed every house and took off all the cattle they could find. A few
weeks before a hurricane had passed over our house and took the roof off the back side.
The British rode up very furiously with their swords drawn and demanded which party
took the roof off the house. I replied, ‘the Upper Party,’ which they understood to mean
the Whigs, the British being the lower party. They then placed a sentinel at the door, who
prevented any of the party from going into the house or taking anything from us, which
we considered as a remarkable Providential preservation.
In the Revolution robberies and murders were frequent in this part of the country.
One night there were two strangers put up at our house from New England. In the dead
of the night a man knocked at the door. Father asked who was there; the reply was a
‘friend.’ Father mistook the voice for that of a particular friend of his, but mother
thought they were robbers beyond any doubt. Father got up and opened the upper half of
the door and soon found his mistake, for they were robbers who had come to rob the
house. Mother jumped out of bed the same time father did. While he was parleying with
the man over the lower door the man stood outside with a gun in his hand and his
companions at his heels. She woke up all her children, seven sons and four daughters
(all as large as men), put men’s coats and hats on the girls, all in not over three minutes,
and marched them into the room where father was. So large a company struck such a
damper on the robbers, that they immediately retreated. We then looked for the strangers
who had put up with us; was a long time before we found them; they were hid away
under their bed, backsides near the wall; they were very much frightened, having $1,500
with them (Continental money, which was then good – this was about 1776). They were
very thankful for their deliverance. The same robbers had a short time before robbed a
tenant house on our premises. It was afterwards found out who the robbers were; they
were arrested, tried and punished by putting them on them the chemises they had stolen
from out tenant, putting them on horseback and marching them off in that style on the
road starting from our farm. I was present when they marched away. One of the robbers
was a neighbor and is still living (Sep 1840) in this neighborhood, but from shame has
not showed himself out of his house these 30 years.
One evening, being detained at work in the fields, on my return towards the house
and when a little west of the house, I suddenly (it being dark) found myself stepping on
some men and was much frightened. These men (about 100) were lying flat on the
ground. Their quarters were at the house now occupied by Joshua Carpenter. An officer
stepped up to me and inquired who I was and where I was going. I replied that I lived in
the house nearby and had been detained at work, that I was then on my way home. He

made me promise to say nothing about what I had seen and then let me go. Their object
was apparently to prevent a surprise or to intercept some enemy.
Joshua Husen was a notorious character in the Revolution. He was connected with
the British Army, though a native of his town (Yorktown). He frequently passed through
the American Army acting as a spy and carrying his information to Canada.
Rochambeau’s Army lay encamped in Yorktown about six weeks. It had not been there
one week before Husen passed through it. He frequently lay in ambush and shot down
American officers or others whom he disliked. All efforts to secure him were
unsuccessful, though large rewards were offered for his apprehension. At length he with
his confederates broke into the house of Seth Whitney (now Barney Montross), abusing
and beating him bodily, carried away everything they wanted. Husen told Whitney that
he would come again and then would kill him. The old man (Whitney) fixed a bayonet
to a rake handle, determined to kill Husen should be come again. At length Husen came
once more, but for the last time. Whitney’s wife told Husen he had better not come into
the house, for her husband would kill him. But disregarding her, he tried to break in;
when about half through the window Whitney stabbed him just below the breastbone,
making a wound about one and one-half inches deep. Husen, nothwithstanding, got into
the room and beat Whitney until he was thought dead. Husen and his fellows then got on
their horses and rode away. At first the family believed Whitney dead, but after a time
they were successful in restoring him and he soon got well. When I saw him the day
after the beating he was dreadfully bruised. Husen’s would prove much more serious
than he at first supposed, for he bled internally, and when within 20 roads of our house
he said, “I am a dead man,” and fell from his horse dead. His comrades applied to some
Tories in the neighborhood, who took the body and buried it about eighteen inches deep
under an apple tree in Veil’s orchard, on the east side of the road. The next day they dug
another grave behind the hill in the woods southeast of William Smith’s house, a very
out-of-the-way place. To conceal the grave they cut down a tree, making it fall over the
grave. Five months afterwards it became generally known that Husen was buried there.
The neighbors dug him up and crowds of people came (some from a great distance) to
see the body, for he was a terror to the whole country around. They wanted to satisfy
themselves that he was really dead. I was proposing to hang the body on a gibbet, but it
was partially put back into the grave, where it probably remained undisturbed. Several
of the men who first buried him were afterwards discovered to be the same that robbed
our tenant house and intended robbing us. Whitney, as a reward for killing Husen, was
exempt from taxes during the remainder of his life. This Husen was of the same family

as the man who was hanged on a gibbet for instigating the negroes’ insurrection in New
York City.
Rochambeau, while in our neighborhood, had his headquarters at my father’s
house. The generals always dined together, dining alternately at each other’s quarters;
once a week they dined at our house. Great preparations were made for the dinner, they
having a French cook who had served in he kitched of a French King, and he had ten
assistants.
Once morning a man came running to our house saying that the party of
Americans under Col. Greene, who were quartered at Danford’s (now Joshua
Carpenter’s), consisting of 50 men, were all killed or wounded. It appeared the British
Light Horse, each rider with another behind him, had surprised the Americans
immediately after they had called in the sentinels in the early morning and had killed or
wounded them as they lay in their tents, which were picketed around the house. At this
time there was a party of Americans stationed at our house commanded by a Lieutenant,
but it was probably unknown to the British, or they might have cut them off at the same
time. Had they attacked the house the family would have been in great danger, for some
of the boys were in bed with the officers, and in the confusion it was scarcely possible
that all would have escaped uninjured. I often thought of making the house musket-proof
by casing the outside with logs.
The house of James Quinby (who married sister Hannah) at Westchester, now
Pearsall’s, was often robbed during the Revolution and the family had a place of
concealment to which they fled whenever the house was attacked. One night Robert
Underhill (my brother), James Underhill and Isaac Mekeel (who afterwards married
sister Hannah when a widow) were at James Quinby’s house when Robert proposed
defending the house when the robbers came, provided James would assist him. That
very night the robbers came, sure enough, but the heart of James failed him and he fled
with the rest. Robert, however, provided himself with a large club and arranged the
chairs along the entry. Then he commenced a violent attack on them, striking them with
his club, stamping and making all the noise he could, as though there were fifty men
inside the house. He struck against the door and dared the robbers to come on, saying,
“We are ready for you,” etc. He then went upstairs and blew a conch. The robbers fired a
volley at the house, but missed him. They then went off; afterwards they reported that
they thought the Devil was in the house.
The British Army had possession of New York. Their northern lines were at Kings
Bridge; the American lines were at Croton River, about 25 miles north of the British
lines. The district between was occasionally occupied by each party and by thieves and

murderers, but few of the former inhabitants of this district chose to remain at home.
There being no cattle to eat the pasture, the grass grew to a great height, so that it fell
down and rotted on the ground from year to year.
In 1777, we being just above the American lines, the cowboys stole from us 14
head of cattle and drove them to Morrisania. Mother, on horseback, traced them to the
British lines. She then determined to appeal to the British generals who were quartered
at Harlem Heights. When she arrived at Kings Bridge she met standing as sentinel the
same light horseman that was posted sentinel at the door of our house when the British
came past after the roof of our house was blown off. He recognized her and she him. He
kindly led her horse across the bridge. She gave him a Pistereen (Jim-money) and went
on her way to the General’s quarters. She proved to the General’s satisfaction that her
husband was one of the people called Quakers, who took no part in the war. He then
gave her an order to the cowboys either to return the cattle or pay for them. She went to
Morrisania and showed the cowboys the order of the General and demanded the cattle.
This put the robbers in a great rage and they threatened to kill her and her family.
Mother thought it too dangerous to carry the money home with her through the neutral
grounds and concluded to deposit it with Israel Underhill, a particular friend of hers,
living at Westchester, who hid it in a stone wall on his farm and gave it back to mother
after she reached home in safety. The object of her journey was, however, known to the
people in our vicinity and the skinners afterwards came to the house and enquired how
she succeeded about the cattle. She told them. They then tried by some kind of
agreement to get the gold from her, for they dare not take it by force. Mother told them
she had left it at Westchester. They told her she had done well, but was a fool for leaving
the money at Westchester.
At another time the cowboys stole three horses from us and took them to
Morrisania. Mother followed them again on horseback and went to the commanding
officer, who compelled the robbers to give them up, so she returned home leading the
three horses.
Brother Robert had a notion of entering into business and bought a quantity of
goods on credit, offering them for sale in the east room (front) of father’s house, brother
Joshua being clerk for him. They remainded there about one year. Robert then married,
Mary, daughter of Jesse Hallock, and moved his goods to her father’s house on the farm
now occupied by William Parker (1848), not far from Hallock’s Mills; a year after he
took Joshua and myself into partnership. Joshua being just about of age, we afterwards
bought the farm and continued there about six years, carrying on a large business for that
time, putting up four or five hundred barrels of pork and beef during a season. Sister

Mary kept house for us until she married. In 1792 we took a lease from Van Cortlandt &amp;
Co. of the mill site at mouth of Croton River, and built a mill of six run of stone. After
the mill was finished Joshua moved to New York to buy wheat for the mill and to sell
the flour manufactured from it. Robert and myself lived at the mill to attend the business
there. In 1804 Robert sold out his one-third of the mill and bought Tellers Point, to
which place he moved his family and lived there until his death. He was an approved
minister of the Society of Friends. Tellers Point yet belongs to two of his sons. Joshua
continued to reside in New York until his death in 1839. The lease of the mill site
expired in 1813. The improvements were appraised, each party selecting one appraiser
and the two a third, namely: Van Cortlandt, a farmer by name Anderson; the Underhills,
Samuel Mott, large flour merchant and miller in New York, and these to selected David
Lydig, the large dealer in flour and most extensive mill owner in the city. Their
appraisement the Van Cortlandts refused to abide by. A suit was commenced against
them, which was not finally settled until 25 years had elapsed and all the original parties
were dead. I removed to Amawalk and resided on the old homestead until I bought the
farm adjoining belonging to the estate of my brother Moses, and on which I now live.</div>
