            <div class="person-text">(3.4.5.1.2.5.5.1.7) ANNE REBECCA FERRIS (Photo) born November 8, 1894 on the farm and died
December 17, 1977, Long Beach CA; buried Sunnyside Cemetery, Long Beach, beside her sister
Pluma. She attended the country schools with her sisters. She graduated from Lorimor High School
1911 and began a semester at Simpson College in Indianola IA, studying music. She was gifted
musically, like her mother, and studied piano while at Simpson. Anne dropped out of school to help her
father care for her mother in 1912. Following her mother’s death in 1921, she followed her sister
Winnie to Des Moines where she also attended business college and went to work. During the 1930s
she went to work for the Keith Furnance Company in Des Moines where she stayed for almost 20
years. She then went to work for the State of Iowa Health Department. She quit work in 1954 and went
to live with her sister Pluma in Long Beach CA. Throughout her retirement, Anne became involved in
volunteering work, particularly with the American Cancer Society; she received many awards for her
service.</div>
