            <div class="person-text">(3.1.1.3.1.4.10.6.6.2.3) ROBERT KEITH FOX (Photograph) born May 3, 1968 Mary Hitch Memorial
Hospital, Hanover NH; baptized in December, 1969, Congregational Church, Plainfield NH; graduated
from Portsmouth Abbey School 1987; University of Maine, Bangor. Robert&#x27;s mother relays &#x27;He always
used to play tricks on me. I remember especially the ceramic frog he put into the sugar bowl and
waited patiently until I came upon it which was several days later. He used to hide from me whenever
he could. Once he hid in cellar window well, he stayed there even though we were getting frantic. We
nearly called the police that day to report a missing child. He finally appeared with an impish grin on
his face, not knowing the state we were in. Robert married, October 3, 1992, at the United Church of
Christ, Jackson ME, Barbara Ann Welch born October 11, 1967 at Alexandria VA - they divorced in
1995. Until March 1995, Robb lived in Bangor ME with his cats where he worked for ServiceMaster, a
professional cleaning company that cleans office buildings. They are also contracted by insurance
companies to clean up after fires, floods or other disasters. In March of 1995, Robb moved to Groton
MA with Anton and Edgar, his two cats, and obtained a position with Sears Roebuck &amp; Co. with their
sales force. He has shown a natural propensity to the task and takes his responsibilities seriously,
displaying the Fox trait for hard work and integrity. In 1996, Robb works for NYNEX.</div>
