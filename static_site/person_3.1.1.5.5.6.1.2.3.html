&quot;(1908) Harlington Wood Recently Admitted To The Bar Comes Into His Duties With Exceptional
Ability. Harlington Wood, who passed the state bar examination at Mount Vernon last week is the son
of Mr. and Mrs. Horace A. Wood of this city and is in every sense a Petersburg young man. Born in
Petersburg he received his elementary education in the schools of this city and was graduated from the

Harris high school and entered the University of Illinois for his collegiate and professional training in
the fall of 1902. Last June he was graduated from the state university taking a degree from the law
school and having completed considerable work in the college of literature and arts. During the interim
between his graduation from the high school and the completion of his studies at Urbana, he was a
teacher in the Menard county schools. His professional training was supplemented by a course of law
reading under the late Hon. N. W. Branson and after the latter&#x27;s demise in the office of the former state&#x27;s
attorney, Thomas P. Reep.
The recently admitted barrister is a young man of much more than ordinary cleverness and with
attainments that peculiarly qualify him for the profession he has chosen. Straightforward, honorable, of
a staunch moral fiber and with a collegiate and professional training that leaves nothing desired, The
Observer bespeaks for his ... success in the law. Mr. Wood has not definitely announced his plans but
for this winter at least will practice in this city.&quot;
&quot;Services for Judge Harlington Wood Sr. of Old Jacksonville Road, who was active in
Republican politics and community affairs and judge of the Sangamon County Court from 1934 to
1950, will be at 1:30 p.m. Saturday at First Christian Church. Dr. Beryl S. Kinser and Rev. Nelson
Scott will officiate and burial will be in Oakland Cemetery at Petersburg.
Judge Wood, 89, died at 1:55 a.m. Thursday at Memorial Medical Center.
Judge Wood, father of Federal Judge Harlington Jr., born on a farm at Petersburg, the son of
Horace and Lizzie Miles Wood, and entered law practice in Springfield upon his graduation from the
University of Illinois 1908.
He was international president of the Optimist Club from 1928 to 1929.
During the time he was judge, he developed such a humanitarian reputation that he was featured
in the October 1948 McCall&#x27;s Magazine. &quot;Harlington Wood was created to be a judge of men,&quot; Morris
Markey wrote. &quot;From the day he left the plow at his father&#x27;s farm and went off to law school, he was
moving toward the place in life that was exactly right for him.&quot; The story dealt with Judge Wood&#x27;s
successful rehabilitation of juvenile offenders.
Judge Wood lost only one election, as an independent candidate for state&#x27;s attorney in 1916.
He was a 25-year member of the Illinois Youth Commission&#x27;s Board, retiring in 1965. Judge
Wood was named a trustee of the Illinois Jurist Pension System in 1941 and also was vice president of
the Juvenile Court Judges Association of Illinois.
Surviving are his wife, Marie G.; one son, Judge Harlington Wood Jr. of Springfield and one
granddaughter.&quot;
Oakland Cemetery, Petersburg, IL. Epitaph: &quot;Athlete, teacher, lawyer, leader, judge, husband, father,
grandfather and a friend to many.&quot; Had a law partnership with Harlington Jr. in Springfield. Read for
the law under Hon. N.W. Branson and the former state attorney, Thomas P. Reep. Bet. 1934 - 1950,
served 16 years as judge of the Sangamon County Court.
