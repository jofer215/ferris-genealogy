            <div class="person-text">(1.1.4.3.5.5.1) HARRISON FERRIS born 1837 NY; enlisted August 14, 1862 at Cold
Spring, Putnam Co NY to serve three years as a Private in Company L of the 6th NY
Heavy Artillery. On December 4, 1862 he was mustered into service at Fort McHenry
MD at the age of 25 years. He was wounded when a musket ball entered the left side of
his neck, on May 19, 1864 near Spotsylvania VA; his hospital admission slip revealed
that he was admitted on May 24, 1864 to Hospital No. 92 of the 2d Division from the
Field Hospital. His nearest relative was listed as his father, Joseph Ferris of Cold Spring
NY. He was returned to duty on July 9, 1864. He was captured by guerrillas on
September 30, 1864 near Woodstock VA and was carried in that capacity through the
muster roll of November/December 1864. On August 24, 1865 Company L was
mustered out of Federal service at Washington, D.C. On the muster roll it was noted that
he was due $16.35 for clothing allowance. On June 23, 1868 Harrison was finally
mustered out of Federal service at Philadelphia. On the Individual Muster Out Roll it
was noted that the A.G.O. had determined that he was mustered out and dishonorably
discharged the service to date August 24, 1865 with loss of all pay, allowances and
bounty in accordance with the provisions of Special Order 114, paragraph 1, dated June
22, 1868. On March 11, 1903 the Record and Pension Office of the War Department
noted that the notation of July 2, 1868 is canceled. It has been determined that the action
of the Commanding General Department of the East purporting to dishonorably
discharge this man, to date August 24, 1865 was taken under a misapprehension of the
powers of the military authorities in such cases, that the same is void and without effect,
and the final record of this soldier is that of a deserter. Apparently his final classification
as a deserter was changed and he was given an honorable discharge as he drew a pension
on his wound received during his service. On October 28, 1879 Harrison filed

Application No. 318,639 for invalid veteran’s pension which was approved under
Certificate No. 219,697. On July 20, 1885, he was 49 years old, a resident of Litchfield
CT and drawing a pension of $4.00 per month due to a wound he had received during
the war. He apparently never married.</div>
