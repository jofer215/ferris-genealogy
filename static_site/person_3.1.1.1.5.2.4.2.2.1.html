(3.1.1.1.5.2.4.2.2.2) BERNICE ALOICE RONK (Photographs) born November 16, 1897 Shell Rock
Township, Greenwood Co, Madison KS and died June 4, 1965; married March 24, 1915 at McPherson
KS Virgil Robert Armstrong born March 8, 1899 five miles east of Matfield Green KS and died 1986;
shortly after their wedding, they moved to a farm near Sioux City IA where they farmed for several
years. By May 1919 they were living in Pisgah IA where they lived until 1925, when they next moved
to the Madison area, where Virgil worked and lived in various leases. Virgil started working, part-time,

he had to make every morning were beyond him, even though he was a smart person; so he provided
the numbers to Bernice who completed the daily reports for him. It was custom for everyone to gather
at the Armstrong house for Sunday dinner. In 1942, Bernice and Virgil bought a farm near Lebo KS for
their retirement years. It had an old house built in the 1800s and they spent many weekends
remodeling the house. After Bernice’s death, Virgil couldn’t live on the farm they had shared for so
many years, so he sold it and bought another five miles west of Emporia KS, where he lived for the rest
of his life, except for the last 6-7 months he was in the nursing home. Virgil married Ruth Wiggins
(Cannon) who had attended school with Bernice and had been friends with them for years. Born to
Bernice and Virgil were:</div>
