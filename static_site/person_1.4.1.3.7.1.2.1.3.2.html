            <div class="person-text">(1.4.1.3.7.1.2.1.3.2) DORIS EMILY FERRIS born January 5, 1929 (Rye) Port Chester
NY; married June 28, 1952 at Rye NY, Joseph Delfosse, Jr., born November 28, 1926
Mt. Kisco NY and died November 14, 1985. Doris was a school teacher for many years
in the Rye City School District. Doris is the provider of the information for this twig of
the Tree - thanks, Doris! She resides in Rye and has written some vignettes which were
published in the local paper. A couple are printed below for your enjoyment: From

the Rye Record, September, 1998: I Remember When..Gypsy Wagons - Growing Up in
Rye in the &gt;30&#x27;s and 40&#x27;s. AIt was the end of September back in the late &gt;30&#x27;s when
two gypsy wagons spent the night in Rye. The gypsies were on their way to their winter
home in the south after spending the spring and summer doing roofing and housing
repair work on the homes in our area and southern Connecticut. It was early evening and
my friend Jeanie Donovan and I, running home through our park (all the Summer people
had gone home), spied the gypsies sitting around their campfire in a vacant lot of an
unfinished street off Dearborn Avenue, where Water’s Edge Condominiums now stand.
Their tall, brightly painted house wagons were parked off to the side of the lot while
their horses grazed on a small patch of grass. The horses looked quite old certainly not
like the horses we had been riding at Kentucky Stables in Harrison. We could see seven
adults gathered around the fire, but there were no children in sight. Maybe there were
already in the wagons. The women were dressed in long, full, brightly colored skirts
which would remind me years later of Navaho clothing I would see in Arizona.
Accompanying the skirts were black or white blouses and lots of necklaces and
bracelets. The men wore very dark clothing dark pants, shirts and small brimmed hats.
Sitting close together on logs around the blaze, they laughed and sang softly,
accompanied by a guitar. We thought it so different and romantic, but stayed hidden
behind the way of Rye Town Park. My mother and father must have known that the
gypsies had visited, because I was warned emphatically not to ever go anywhere near
them because they steal children! Little did they know that my friend and I had already
seen the forbidden, leaving me with a vivid memory I would never forget. The Rye
Record, October, 1998: I Remember When...War on the Home Front. World War II was
declared. It was such a serious and scary time for all families, especially the children.
There were so many things to which we had to adjust or do without. What scared me the
most were the blackout current which were required over our windows so no lights
could be seen from outside. Wardens and Boy Scouts patrolled the streets after dark to
see if any lights were visible. One, Mr. Miller, who lived around the corner from us,
would rap on our door with a night stick and tell us to pull our curtains tighter. We lived
on Forest Avenue, where street lights were never on because we faced the park, which in
turn looked out to the beach and Long Island Sound. We had been told that a German
submarine had gone up the sound, and that all the telephone lines to Fort Slocum, in
New Rochelle, had been cut. In Girl Scouts, we were given the opportunity to learn
Morse code, and we carried a metal Morse code box with us all the time. It ran on
batteries, with the send key and a light bulb on the outside, to use in case of an
emergency. We were also taught the shapes of airplanes, and spent many hours on the

beach practicing spotting. It was a skill we never had to use. Teachers at Milton School
encouraged us to buy war stamps which we glued into a folder. When filled, it would
buy a war bond. The stamps were sold the first thing every morning. We also filled Red
Cross boxes with personal things for servicemen; we brought in tooth powder, a tooth
brush, shaving soap, a washcloth, a small bar of soap, a pencil, a Hershey bar and a
small box of Chiclets gum. I put our name and address inside, but I never heard from
anyone who received my boxes. There were many other war activities in which Rye
families participated. Children went around their neighborhoods, pulling wagons to
collect aluminum pots and pans, donated for the war effort. Other children, as well as
adults, were asked to roll bandages at the Rye Red Cross, located where the mini-mall is
today. Since my sister and I knew how to sew and knit, we were invited to work with the
ladies of Rye to learn how to use the knitting machines to make socks for servicemen
and sew pajamas for those in hospitals. We felt very grown-up to be included and went
practically every day after school to do our service. My family was always running our
of ration stamps. It seems you needed them for everything - meat, sugar, gasoline, tires,
shoes and more. My mother warned me not to dance on the sidewalk because I wore out
my shoes much too fast, and she didn’t have enough stamps to buy me more. We also
had to walk or take the bus everywhere because Dad had only enough gas stamps to get
to and from work. One time we had to request a special allottment to go visit my
seriously ill grandmother.The war really hit home for my family when my brother turned
18 in March of his senior year, and was called the following day to enter the Army. He
wasn’t allowed to attend graduation, but he and five others were praised at the ceremony
as brave and honorable citizens who were helping to save our country. It was a difficult
time.
Another one: Christmas was such an enchanting time at home when I was growing up.
My parents worked such maginc for us. Before Christmas, my mother baked dozens and
dozens of cookies which we gave as Christmas presents to all our neighbors and friends.
The children’s jobs were to chop the nuts, cut up candied cherries, blanch almonds and
roll the pfeffernuesse, or peppernuts as we called them, in powdered sugar and then help
pack them all in white boxes we bought from the bakery shop in Port Chester. As was
our family custom, the Christmas tree magically appeared fully decorated on Christmas
morning. It was tall, extremely full and a dazzling sight. It was covered with fragile,
German hand-blown ornaments in the shapes of Santa, French honrs, snowmen, angeliclike faces and even clusters of grapes. The tree had lights and tinsel with a village set
under it. My grandfather made a beautiful fence of white-painted popsicle sticks to go
around the village and my brother’s trains were around the whole display. It was quite a

few years later that I found out how our tree always appeared so magically. My father
and his friend from childhood, Chauncey Gannun, who came year after year, set up and
decorated the tree. They were truly masters at this! We were sent to bed with dire threats
that if we peeked, we would get only coal in our stocking rather than the usual fruit,
nuts, pennies and hair ribbons. We always heard suspicious noises and even sleigh bells,
but after our story of The Night Before Christmas, we were tucked into bed with never a
peep from us. I especially remember my skate Christmas. It was the year I got my first
pair of figure skates rather than having to always use the family hockey skates. Now I
could play hockey as well as try figure skating. I already had had a sled Christmas, a
Shirley Temple doll Christmas, a bicycle Christmas, but at eight years old, figure skates
and guards were just perfect. We did a lot of skating on the duckpond in the Rye Town
park which was across the street from where I lived. The duckpond, at that time, was at
least three times the size of what it is today. We would skate in the morning and then
look for our signal, a red flag in the flower box, to call us home for lunch. We put on our
skate guards and hopped over the stonewall to home. Hot tomato soup, delicious
smelling, homemade cinnamon rolls hit the spot as well as having a dry pair of warm
mittens to take back skating. When we were older, we would often walk to Mead’s pond
to skate and there would meet our friends from other parts of Rye. That year during
Christmas dinner, Dad told us a wonderful story about when he was a young boy and
what happened at the duckpond. He and two of his brothers had walked over the the
duckpond from their home in Milton and were going to take turns sharing a pair of
skates. He said the pond was very crowded with girls in their long skirts and boys in
their knickers skating in all directions when suddenly there was a lot of shouting.
Slowly, before their eyes, the whole covering of ice just sank down in the water and the
skaters had to scramble, in water up to their knees, to get off and onto the wall. My
father and brothers thought it was such a funny sight to see skaters slowly sinking and
Dad chuckled again when he told us this story years later. I brought many of the customs
which my parents initiated for their children=s holiday to my own holidays and it is so
nostalgic to see that my own children often do the same things with their children as I
did when I was growing up. Thanks, Doris, for sharing these with us. Born to them
