            <div class="person-text">(1.2.5.3) ISAAC UNDERHILL born June 21, 1726 Yorktown NY and died there
December 28, 1814; buried Amawalk NY; farmer, Quaker; resided 1760 Mt Pleasant
NY; 1774 moved to York; and then Rye NY; married August 18, 1756 Sarah Field [dau
of Robert &amp; Rebekah (Burling) Field] born February 6, 1734 Purchase NY and died
March 20, 1812 Yorktown. Bolton in his History of Westchester County, NY, states: “In
the old family mansion which stands on the Pines Bridge Road, is shown the room in
which Major Andre and Joshua H Smith breakfasted on September 23, 1780. At this
period the house was occupied by Isaac and Sarah Underhill, she a daughter of Robert
Field, whose nephew was a resident of Yorktown, and appears to have been a woman of
good resolution and courage. While entertaining Andre and his companion she took
particular notice of the former and imagined she read in his confusion a person
embarrassed in some great undertaking. A few days previous to this event she had
visited headquarters to recover some cattle carried off by a band of marauders.” Born to
