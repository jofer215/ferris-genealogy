            <div class="person-text">(1.4.7.3.2) ALFRED SANDS PELL born March/May 1, 1786 and died April 20, 1831;
married Adelia Duane [daughter Colonel James Duane, first Mayor of New York City
after the Rev. War and also a member of the US Supreme Court]. He purchased an estate
in Esopus of 114 acres on the Hudson just above Esopus Island, and at the same time a
tract of 143 acres, also on the river, at the northern end of what is now West Park. At his
death he left the former and the Esopus Island to his oldest son, Robert Livingston Pell,
and the latter to his widow and younger children (James Duane Pell, John Augusta Pell,

George W. Pell, and Richard M. Pell). James and Richard’s names appear on several
deeds in the Ulster County records, but it is doubtful if they changed their primary
residence to Ulster, or even used it as a summer residence. More likely they were simply
real estate investors. As part of their expansion, James Duane Pell purchased the lower
half of the Payne tract from Widow Wurts in 1837 for $8,000 of which $7,000 was a
mortgage to the Widow payable in a balloon payment in 1842, but then sold it in 1840 to
Archibald Russell. Alfred Sands Pell’s nephew, also named Alfred Sands Pell (18051869), an agent for an English marine insurer, was a cofounder of Mutual Life Insurance
Company of New York (MONY) in 1843, which by 1870 became the leading insurer in
the country.

The Alfred S. Pell Memorial Elm; not Hangman’s Elm By Luther S. Harris
One tiny change need not wait for Washington Sq.’s projected renovation (as reported in The Villager’s Dec. 10 issue).
Among the signage in the square, nothing cries out more for replacement than the small plaque on the great English elm at
the square’s northwest corner, long misnamed the “Hangman’s Elm.” It should be named instead for the man who long ago
saved it, one Alfred S. Pell. First of all, no one was ever executed by hanging from the elm. New York State law governed
executions and mandated use of a gallows erected in a public place by order of the city’s sheriff — a practice dating from
colonial times. One such place was the potter’s field, which formed the nucleus of Washington Sq. Secondly, the elm was
not even on that public ground until the square reached full size in 1828. Vigilantes may, by chance, have hung a
Revolutionary War-era loyalist or two from the elm in the distant past. However, there is no record of such an illegal event
and the anonymous elm was but one in a row of many trees lining an English colonial farm. Nevertheless, despite clear
evidence to the contrary, the “Hangman’s Elm” myth has persisted for a century. Now forgotten, Alfred S. Pell was the
public-spirited gentleman who, in 1827, facilitated the square’s expansion from the potter’s field by selling his 21/2 acres
west of Minetta Creek, which included the elm. By selling at a nominal price, Pell gave up approximately $227,000 (over
$4 million in today’s value) in potential profit that he could have obtained from residential development of the parcel. (The
decade of 1825-’35 was a period of residential building speculation.) Pell’s munificent act assured that the square’s cost to
the city, necessitating onerous assessments on surrounding properties, would be acceptable. It was this enlargement, which
adorned the city with a grand public square instead of a mediocre one; Columbia College’s president Charles King,
summing up the city’s progress in 1851, singled out Pell for praise in referring to Washington Sq. as one of the city’s
significant achievements. The elm, whose age was established by the Parks &amp; Recreation Department in 1989, is some 310
years old. No tree in Manhattan is known to be older and the elm has outlived the city’s other most historic trees:
Stuyvesant’s pear tree at the northeast corner of 13th St. and Third Ave. and the great tulip tree at Shorakapkok in
Washington Heights. The Washington Sq. elm has survived by its inclusion in the square and surely deserves a name
befitting its longevity and true significance. Calling it the Alfred S. Pell Memorial Elm would do just that. Pell assisted the
square in another way. He was related to the Westchester Pells and married Adelia Duane, the daughter of the city’s first
mayor and granddaughter of Robert Livingston, the proprietor of Livingston Manor on the Hudson. This elite couple was
one of a group that built the city’s first terrace row on the south side of the square between MacDougal and Thompson Sts.
(since demolished). With the Pells and other prominent names in residence, the row put the square on the social map of the
city and contributed to Fifth Ave.’s rise to fame. Alfred S. Pell died in 1831 on an ocean voyage before he could see the
success he helped make. His name on the elm would be a fitting commemoration. More importantly, it might also spark
wider interest in keeping this wonderful tree alive and healthy given the problems in funding any improvements for the
square. Saving this elm today is just as important as it was 175 years ago when Washington Sq. was created.
