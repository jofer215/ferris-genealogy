Spring - Word was received in Cold Spring today of the death of Leonard Jaycox, 74,
former Sheriff of Putnam County, at his winter home in Daytona Beach, Fla. Contractor,
livery stable owner, sheriff and supervisor, Mr. Jaycox had a colorful career. He for years
was not only one of the best known but most popular and highly respected residents of
Putnam County. When the New York City water supply aqueduct was put through
Putnam County Mr. Jaycox held the contract for all the hauling on the huge job. At one
time he had as many as 50 teams and trucks at work. He held numerous contracts on
state and county highway and other projects in and around the county. The Jaycox livery
stables in Cold Spring not only furnished horses and carts for rough haulage work, but
supplied spirited steeds and canopied carriages for the fashionable residents of Cold
Spring and Garrison. Mr. Wilcox served with distinction as sheriff of Putnam County
and put in a number of terms as supervisor from the Town of Philipstown. Still known as
sheriff although it was 15 or 20 years since he held that office, Mr. Jaycox celebrated his
74th birthday on August 22. He was born in Putnam Valley, the son of the late David and
Mary Ferris Jaycox. Of recent years he resided at his home on Orchard Street, Cold
Spring, going to his winter home at Daytona Beach during the cold months. He was a
member of the Cold Spring Methodist Church. Fraternally, he was affiliated with
Philipstown Lodge, F.&amp;A.M and the I.O.O.F. Surviving are the widow, Hattie Griffin
Jaycox, one sister, Mrs. Everette Baxter of South Highlands and one brother, George

Jaycox of Garrison. The body has been shipped north for burial in Cold Spring
