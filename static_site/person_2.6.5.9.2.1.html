Stamford Advocate

ISAAC WARDWELL IS DEAD
In 90th Year, But Active Till A Few Days Ago
HELPED PROGRESS OF TOWN
Entering Waring’s Foundry as a Boy, He Became the Head of Business Which Still Flourishes -- His Twin Sister,
Mrs. Hoyt, Still Survives. Isaac Wardwell died yesterday, at 5 p.m., at his home in Elm Street. He was stricken
with apoplexy last Monday, and at no time after that was there much hope for his recovery. Unconscious nearly
every moment from the time of the attack, his fatal illness was attended by little suffering. The deceased was a
son of Isaac Wardwell, born in Stamford, Dec. 28, 1766, and was one of 14 children. He born at the Westcotts
farm home of his father, Dec. 10, 1815. His twin sister, Betsy, who married Rev. William C. Hoyt, May 1838, is
the only survivor of the fourteen. Mr. Wardwell passed his boyhood at his father’s homestead. He received a
good common-school education. In 1832 he was apprenticed to the carpenter’s trade, and served five years at it.
In 1838, he went to work for George Waring, in the Rippowam Foundry, and in 1846 he became the junior
member of the firm. In 1851 the firm became J.D. Warren &amp; Co., and subsequently it became a stock company
under the name of the Stamford Foundry Co., of which J.D. Warren was made president. Mr. Wardwell
continued his interest in the firm, and up to his day of his sudden illness was in the habit of visiting the offices
frequently. Mr. Wardwell was one of the promoters and builders of the Canal, and he was also instrumental in a
good deal of the later harbor improvement. He held stock in the First National Bank of Stamford, which by the
way, is the oldest national bank in the United States. His business career was characterized by rugged honesty,
shrewdness and sound judgment. His health has been remarkable, considering his age. Up to the day he was
stricken ill, he was able to go about every day, driving, and transacting business. Until a few years ago he used to
take a lot of delight sailing in the sound. He was a great fisherman. On April 27, 1847, Mr. Wardwell married
Miss Frederica L. Shaw, a daughter of Frederick Shaw. There were four children by the union – Anna Wilkinson,
Ida Louise, Dr. I. Franklin Wardwell, a dentist who has been actively identified with the Stamford Yacht Club,
and Dr. Claison S. Wardwell, also a dentist. The Wardwells have been active members of St. John’s Church. Mr.
Wardwell helped many young men in this town by his advice, and started some upon the road to a successful
career in business. He had large real estate holdings near the canal, and had great faith in the growth of the town.
Shrewd in making investments, he was nevertheless very kind-hearted, and many will testify to his generous
qualities. His greatest activity was during a generation of Stamfordites of whom few are left, for Isaac Wardwell
was active in affairs here in more than half a century ago. In his private life he was devoted to his family, and his
home was singularly happy. It was the constant aim of his children to make his declining years peaceful and
comfortable. He was not, however, the type of man willing to relinquish his grasp upon business when old age
crept on. Full of energy since boyhood, he seemed to like work just as well at a time when most men would be
satisfied to go into retirement. Isaac Wardwell’s life contributed materially to the progress of his native town. He
has left a record of which his children and his fellow citizens may feel proud.
Stamford Foundry Company. As of 1892
About the year 1830 a small foundry was established at Long Ridge by George E. Waring. It proving a success,
he purchased in Stamford village, the Gothic House property at the head of Atlantic Street, extending on Bedford
Street somewhat beyond Spring Street, and in 1836 built thereon a new foundry; the warehouse of which - being
years afterwards removed to the opposite side of Bedford Street and converted into dwellings - is now known as
the Five Chimney House. The manufacture of stoves and agricultural implements was successfully carried on at
this place until, in 1840, Mr. Waring bought the old Rolling Mill on Mill River at Main Street, added new
buildings and removed the business to that location. Here, in 1846, Isaac Wardwell, who entered the employ of
Mr. Waring in 1838, together with James B. Scofield, and afterward Joseph D. Warren were associated with Mr.
Waring and did a flourishing business under the name of the &quot;Rippowam Company.&quot; In 1849, Mr. Waring
retiring, the name was changed, and J. D. Warren &amp; Co. continued until the expiration of the lease, when, in

1851, they erected necessary buildings near the head of the old canal, and removed thither. Business was
afterwards conducted at the Main Street location by a new &quot;Rippowam Company,&quot; but unsuccessfully, and the
property was afterwards used as a woolen mill until the buildings were consumed by fire in 1886. Business at the
Canal Foundry increased, and in 1869, the same owners formed the Stamford Foundry Company with a capital
of $40,000, and, Pacific Street being opened, they opened Canal Street on the line of the tow-path of the canal,
through their own land to the N. Y. &amp; N. H. R. R. and enlarged the works to their present dimensions. The
Foundry property has a frontage of about 350 feet on Canal Street, and covers about two acres of ground. The
main building for molding and casting. built of stone and brick is 71X200 feet, the warehouse 75x113 feet.
Besides these, there are pattern shop, boiler house, drill shops, and pattern storage buildings. These works have
capacity for employing one hundred men in manufacturing stoves and ranges, which are made in great variety of
styles and sizes for cooking, heating and laundry purposes, as well as furnaces and apparatus for heating
dwellings, stores, churches, etc. The owners and managers are all natives, and life-long residents of Stamford.

He married April 27, 1847 in Stamford, Frederica Louisa Shaw [dau of Frederick &amp; Louisa W. (Baker)
Shaw] born October 6, 1824 CT and died November 3, 1911 Stamford; buried there Woodland
Cemetery; and born to them were (not in birth sequence):</div>
