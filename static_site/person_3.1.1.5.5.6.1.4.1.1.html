            <div class="person-text">(3.1.1.5.5.6.1.4.1.1) JAMES STEPHEN MILES IV (Jimmy) born November 16, 1953; married Vera W
{mnu}; “In Celebration of the Life of James Miles,” from the program of his memorial service,
February 25, 2006. “James Stephen Miles, son of James Shelby Miles and Virginia Williams, passed
away at his home in Chicago on February 21, 2006 around 5 p.m. He was president of union 394, The
Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (BLET). His family played some role of note in Illinois history,
helping to organize Illinois state fairs and the construction and restoration of New Salem, the historic
village of Abraham Lincoln’s young manhood. In fact, his father quaried and laid the first foundation
stone of the New Salem Village. James Miles served in the rail industry for almost 30 eyars, starting as
a switchman at the Chicago Northwestern Proviso yard and with the Belt Railway of Chicago,
becoming a locmotive engineer a few years later. At the time of his death, he was active in advocating
worker and public safety by organizing fellow union members and others to publicize the deleterious
effects of the recently implemented remote control operations of locomotives, founding the National
Committee Against Unmanned Locomotives. For 35 years, Jim was a political activist and scholar
participating in anti-war, civil rights, and the feminist movement. In 1994, he presented in Moscow a
paper on how Leon Trotsky as early as the 1930’s predicted and fought agaist the collapse of the Soviet
Union and how the revolution could be restored to its original spirit and tasks. He launched RMT, a
journal of political theory analysis. James Stephen Miles dedicated his life to justice, peace and human
liberation. His wife and collaborator, Vera W Miles, survives him.” Thanks to Elaine Cidcombe for
