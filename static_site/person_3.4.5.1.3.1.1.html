            <div class="person-text">(3.4.5.1.3.1.1) LONDREE NICHOLAS FERRIS born June 3, 1821 Stephenstown NY and died April
14, 1897 Barry, Pike, IL. Londree passed his early life in his native town and acquired a good
education, as he attended school quite steadily until 1839. In that year accompanied by his aunt Almira
Harris and sister, he started West. In 1840, after his father’s death, his mother and sister (unidentified)
came to Pike County and they both died there. Londree came to Illinois by the way of the Eric Canal to
Buffalo, and thence by lake to Cleveland, from there by the Ohio Canal to Portsmouth, and from
Cincinnati by the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers to Pike County. He bought 160 acres of land, paying
$600.00 for the tax title and $150.00 for the patent. He built a frame house, obtaining a part of the
timber from Quincy IL, and the relatives who accompanied him remained with him until death parted
them, his sister dying at the age of 26 years. Londree lived on his farm until 1886, and in the meantime
placed it under substantial improvement and good cultivation, and then sold it and removed to the city
of Barry, where he resided until his death. He was a pioneer of Pike County IL, a good citizen who is
well considered by all who knew him; a Democratic in politics and was elected Justice of Peace in
1858, county coroner for one term, and was Justice, or still Justice, in 1889. He married, March 19,
