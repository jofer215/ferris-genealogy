            <div class="person-text">(1.6.1.4) DANIEL FERRIS born North Castle, Westchester, NY April 23, 1752 and
died Bedford May 16, 1831; married 1771 Hanna (Hannah) Banks [dau of John &amp;
Deborah (Newman) Banks] from Middle Patent born North Castle November 23, 1753
and died Bedford June 22, 1824. Daniel was a farmer and lived at the foot of the hill on
the Danbury Post Road just on the Bedford Town Line. He inherited his father&#x27;s Bedford
lands. He did sell one hundred acres to James Ferris (his son?) for $1,000.00 as
evidenced by an 1827 deed. He was a private in the Westchester County militia and saw
active service. He was taken prisoner by the British, and was confined to the Sugar
House prison in New York and later exchanged. Hannah and Dan were buried in the
Ferris Cemetery, plots 4 and 5, respectfully. From the Town of Bedford Westchester
County NY Historical Records Volume VII: Houses outside Bedford Village generally
escaped burning in the July 11, 1779 raid. How one such home was saved was described
in this family story written down in 1885 by Mrs. William Benedict of Pleasantville as
related to her by her grandparents, Daniel and Hannah Ferris. The confusion of dates is
characteristic of many of these reminiscences. “In April 1777 my grand parents saw the
village of Bedford burned by the British soldiers when returning from the burning of
Danbury Ct. On the east side of the road in the south part of Bedford leading to White
Plains was the farm house of my grandfather Daniel Ferris. The British soldiers went in

the house to burn it, There being no fire to do so It having been all quenched. The three
soldiers went directly to a log house at a short distance west to get a brand of fire with
which to burn the farmhouse. On returning with the fire as they were nearly there, they
were fired into by a party of six Americans who secreted behind the trees on the hill
above the house. One of the three men fell to the ground, together with the brand of fire.
His two comrades took him up in their arms, and carried him on the road south. In this
way the house was rescued from being burned by the British soldier. On the road from
Bedford to White Plains in the northern part of North Castle was the farmhouse of my
great grand father John Ferris. The British soldiers burned his house to the ground on the
same day that they burned the village of Bedford. In July 1777 Daniel Ferris my
grandfather was taken prisoner by the British soldiers and imprisoned in the Sugar
House in New York City where he was kept three days and three nights without food of
any kind to eat. And only a pint of water each day to drink. When almost starving he was
exchanged with other for British prisoners and set at liberty. I always saw and heard my
grand father relate this circumstance of his life with tears”. We have another conflict
here – the following contradicts the above: In the Rev. War Daniel sympathized with the
British. When he married he removed to Fishkill Flats. He was a prisoner in the Sugar
House in NY where he nearly starved, when he was exchanged for a British prisoner and
set free. He went to Upper Canada with part of his family and remained there. This was
told by Catharine (Ferris) Benedict to Mrs. Lora C. Little of Croton-on-Hudson, who
was preparing a history of the Ferris Family in America. Catharine is a great niece of
Daniel. Her father is James Ferris mother Deborah Clark Ferris. Born to Daniel and
Hanna were:</div>
