(3.1.1.1.5) ENOCH FERRIS (Rev.) born May 10, 1762 Poundridge, Dutchess, NY and died October
6, 1830. When Enoch was two years old, his family moved back to Stanwich CT and later to Canaan,
which was then Albany County but is now Columbia County NY. While in Canaan, Enoch joined the
Baptist Church in the adjoining town of New Lebanon, and there he was married and his first two
children were born. Between 1784-87, the family moved back to Dutchess County, to the town of
Southeast, which was then included in Frederickstown. Here in 1787, Enoch was ordained as a Baptist
minister. He preached at Salem and Phillipstown in Westchester Co until he was called to Nassau,
Rensselaer County. He was sent in 1816, by the Baptist’s Missionary Society, to Oswego Co. NY and
while living in Mexico and Richland he ministered a large part of the county. As the pioneers whom he
served as pastor were very poor and the stipend paid by the Society very small for such a large circuit,
he labored in great poverty much of the time. The First Baptist Church of Palermo in Oswego County
NY was organized in 1817 with Elder Enoch Ferris as the pastor. He became the first pastor the Baptist
Church of South Richland October 11, 1817 and officiated in that capacity during a number of years. In
1828, he was the pastor of the First Baptist Church at Richland, Oswego County NY. In 1826, Enoch
inherited $1500.00 from his uncle, the Rev. Ebenezer Ferris, however, Enoch chose to continue his
missionary labors in spite of increasing infirmities, making his last trip into the southern part of the
county in August and preaching his last sermon about three weeks before his death in October. The
little real estate he owned, he transferred to his sons Ebezener and Enoch M., shortly before his death.
He married, November 2/9, 1780, Rebecca Reynolds born April 6, 1765 and died December 11, 1841.
REV. ENOCH FERRIS, BAPTIST MISSIONARY TO OSWEGO COUNTY
By g-g-g-granddaughter Esther Rancier
The first official record of the Jeffery Ferris family has been found in the Colonial Records at Boston, MA 6
May 1635. By 1642 Jeffery and his wife Mary had a son James Ferris born 1642/43 in Stamford, CT. The Ferris family
was one of the founders of Stamford.
Jeffery’s son Joseph, born 20 September 1635, became a founding settler of Greenwich, CT. He married Ruth
Knapp, daughter of Nicholas and Elinor Knapp. Joseph’s oldest son was John born ca. 1658 in Greenwich. John married
Abigail Hoyt/Haight 13 December 1695 in Norwalk, CT. John’s oldest son was another John, born 25 April 1696 at
Greenwich. This John married Sarah Mead. Their oldest son was yet another John, born 7 November 1723 at Greenwich.
This 6th generation John Ferris married Hannah Mead, daughter of Elisha Mead. John and his wife were two of
the earliest converts to the Baptist Church of Greenwich. The earlier family members worshipped at the Second
Congregational Church at Greenwich where the family records still exist.
John6 moved from Greenwich into New York State first to Albany County which at that time encompassed a
huge area. John probably lived for a time somewhere in what is now Rensselaer County. By 1762 John and Hannah were
living in Pound Ridge, Westchester Co., NY. Enoch, the youngest child, born there 10 May 1762.
About 1764 they returned to Stanwich Parish, Greenwich. By 1777 they returned to the Hudson River Valley at
Canaan, NY which at that time was part of Albany County. Now Canaan is in Columbia County. Just down the Flat Brook
Road in Canaan was New Lebanon, NY where Enoch joined the church. On 9 November 1780 he married Rebecca
Reynolds there.
Rebecca was probably the daughter of Moses Reynolds who was on the Tax List of Canaan in 1779 living a
couple of houses away from John Ferris and John Ferris, Jr. Moses, like the Ferrises, came from Stanwich Parish in
Greenwich. He was baptized into the Baptist faith in 1770. By 6 November 1773 the Baptists had organized their church
which included Moses Reynolds, Rebecca Reynolds, John Ferris and Hannah Ferris. It is believed that this same Moses
lived in 1790 at Stephentown, Rensselaer Co., NY.
Between 1784 and 1787 Enoch and Rebecca removed to Dutchess Co. at Southeast which at that time was part of
Fredericksontown. In 1787 Enoch was ordained a Baptist minister. He preached at Salem and Phillipstown in Westchester

Co. until he was called to Nassau, Rensselear Co. before 1800. In 1800 he was listed as living at Stephentown, several
doors away from Moses Reynolds.
Very little is known about the events of Enoch’s life while he was in Rensselaer Co., but some documents remain.
On 18 August 1801 Enoch and Cabot Brown each leased part of the farm of James McWade and Jacob Crandall at
Stephentown. Enoch was named executor of Marcus Dimond’s will which was written 4 May 1803 at Stephentown.
Nicolas Husted had Enoch witness his will written 29 August 1814 at Nassau.
In 1816 Ferris was sent by the Baptist Missionary Society to Oswego Co., NY. He lived both in Mexico and
Richland. He was a supply pastor at various new Baptist churches which were being established as the population grew. So
tiny were the first congregations that they didn’t always hold services every Sunday. Enoch would alternate where he gave
his sermons. Sometimes he shared the pulpit with another pastor. Church buildings were not yet erected, so many
preachings took place in private homes. The worshippers probably preferred the homes as they were likely to be heated. It
was not the custom to warm a formal church. Colonial Christians believed that one could not have fire in a house of
worship. Oswego County had long, hard, cold winters because of the wind whipped snow off Lake Ontario. At some point
stoves were installed in churches, but this occurred long after Enoch’s day.
On 7 October 1817 the Baptist Church of South Richland was organized. Enoch Ferris became the first pastor
on 11 October 1817. He stayed a number of years, until about 1828. All these services took place in private homes.
In the same fall of 1817 Enoch and others ministered to a small band as the Baptist Church of Fulton. But the
group failed to grow so the church became the First Baptist Church of Palermo since most of the congregants lived there.
Again these sermons were in intimate settings of private residences.
After 1821 Enoch became the second pastor of the Colosse Baptist Church. In 1828 he was pastor at the First
Baptist Church at Richland. He was one of the delegates who helped to found this church on 17 May 1828 in a meeting
held at the courthouse in Pulaski, NY.
Very little is known of his theology beyond his beliefs in standard Baptist dogma which differ most markedly
from other Protestant religious groups in their views on baptism. Baptists never baptize infants. In order to receive the
sacrament of baptism, a person must voluntarily choose this rite. Normally only persons over 14 are baptized.
Enoch did also believe in temperance which today is strongly practiced by Baptists. In Enoch’s time temperance
was not widely practiced. Early Americans consumed vast amounts of beer. Even children drank some. Public
drunkenness was common. Churches rarely spoke from the pulpit on the subject so widely was drunken behavior accepted.
On 20 June 1829 110 members of Enoch’s flock, “Voted unanimously that this church do hereby resolved that
each and every member refrain from the use of ardent spirits in any case except as medicine.”
Historian Crisfield Johnson called the Reverend “of unimpeachable character.” John Churchill, another Oswego
County writer, noted, “Rev. Enoch Ferris, an old fashioned preacher of Richland.”
Because of the Rev. Enoch’s many years as pastor of the Baptist church at South Richland, he was well known
to the Holmes family who pioneered the area. In the long memoir about this family published 1900-1902 by Rev. Jesse H.
Jones there are these comments: “The church was founded in 1817 with five members, but the names can not be learned.
Probably John Holmes was one. The church was gathered by the labors of Elder Enoch Ferris, then a missionary in the
county. Elder Jesseniah Holmes joined that same year. Elder Ferris joined in 1819, and together they supplied the church.”
Years later Rev. Enoch’s daughter-in-law Mrs. Elizabeth (Douglas) Ferris
wrote, “I became a resident of South Richland in 1824 when I united with that church by letter from Whitesboro. The
church was small, consisting mostly of elderly people. I think I was the youngest member. Rev. Enoch Ferris, the father of
my husband, E. M. Ferris, was the pastor. I never heard of them having a previous pastor. As he was a former missionary
for that county, it seems natural to suppose that he was the one who assisted in forming the church….

“I can mention some of the early members, but can not tell whether they were the first, though I think they
were. They were Rev. Enoch Ferris, his wife and daughter, Elizabeth; Deacon Bangs, Deacon Bump and their wives; John
Homes, clerk; Mrs. (Roxy) Dewey and Mrs. Hiel Richards later.”
Being a pastor kept Rev. Enoch in poverty. His only land record in Oswego Co. happened in 1819. Enoch and
his son, Silvester took a mortgage of $245 on the west half of small lot 3 in Parish. On 8 November 1820 Enoch and
Silvester paid $264.67 principal plus interest to the holder of the mortgage, Simon Adams. The men failed to register this
payment,

a common event. Silvester was requested by the court to do so on 18 July 1836 to clear title on the land for Joseph
Bloomfield.
In 1825/26 a relative, Rev. Ebenezer Ferris died. He left his nephew Enoch $1500 which was sufficient to cover
his needs until he died.
As Enoch became increasingly infirm he chose to continue preaching in the southern part of the state. In August
1830 he left Oswego Co. His last sermon was three weeks before his death on 6 October 1830. Author Harriet Scofield
believed he owned land in Orange Co., NY which went to sons Ebenezer and Enoch M. before his death. Enoch and
Rebecca were buried in the Willis Cemetery at Richland.
Enoch and Rebecca’s children were:
Marilda b. 26 July 1781; m. (1) 9 November 1797 James E. Lockwood who d. 1812; (2) Stephen Congdon
who d. ca.1829; d. 12 December 1859.

According to the probate file of Ebenezer Ferris dated 2 February
1850 his heirs were Susan Ferris, widow; brother Enoch M. Ferris; sister Elizabeth Ferris of Richland; sister Rebecca
Belding, wife of Job K. Belding of Richland; sister Marilda Congdon of Scriba, NY; sister Nancy M. Nye, wife of Joel
Wilson Nye of Stockbridge, Madison Co., NY; brother Silvester Ferris of Delaware Township, Riley Co., IN; the children of
sister Samantha Ingham, deceased, viz. Ruth Sibley, wife of Comfort Sibley of Palermo, NY and Samuel Ingham of
Oswego. Ebenezer’s wife and brother Enoch M. were executors.
1.

Marilda and James Lockwood, son of Jeremiah and Abigail (Smith) Lockwood had at least 5 children: Ambrose
K., Marilla, Daniel H., Sylvan F., Alanson I., and possibly Sylvester(?). They lived in Scriba, NY. Stephen Congdon,
Marilda’s second husband died before 20 Ooctober 1829 as an application for Letters of Administration was filed then with
the Oswego Co. Surrogate Court. In the 1850 census Marilda lived with Sylvester Lockwood, his wife Angeline and five
children.
Rev. Silvester Ferris and Rhoda King had 7 children. Rhoda died 1 August 1857. Daughters Samantha Ferris
married GeorgeWood; Laura Betsey Ferris married Benjamin King; Lydia Louise Ferris married Asa Cook; Susannah
Rebecca Ferris married Lyman F. Smith; Diantha McIvina Ferris married David Ellis; and Jane Melicent Ferris married
William L.H. Given. Son Edwin Palmer Ferris wed Sibyl Foster Stevens.
Samantha and Alanson Ingham had two children: Ruth and Samuel. Alanson was the son of Joseph and
Mehitabel (Brown) Ingham of Durham, CT. Ruth born 1809. She married Comfort Sibley, son of Abner, but by 1850 he
was deceased. They lived in Palermo, NY. According to the 1850 census their children were Charlotte 21; Elvira 18;
Lucretia 17; Charles 15; Samuel 13; James 10; and Jane 6. Also in the household was Abner 77. These Sibley youths were
some of the grandchildren of Rev. Enoch.
Rebecca Ferris and Job K. Belding resided in Richland. They had four children but only two had heirs. Martha
A. Belding married Hiram Norton and resided in Albion, NY. Elvira Van Dressen Belding married Charles Henry Davis and
lived in Mexico, NY.

Joel Wilson Nye, born 29 January 1802 in Eaton, Madison Co., NY, son of Bonum Nye and Anna Recard of
Plymouth, MA, married in 1834 Nancy Melvina Ferris in Oswego Co. They had two children: Sophia Payne Nye and
Enoch Randolph Nye. Enoch R. born 17 May 1834 in Mexico. Sophia born 1836/37 in Attica, Wyoming Co., NY.
Although persons named Ferris remained in Oswego County, they were not descendants of Rev. Enoch. The last
one bearing the family name was Enoch Mead Ferris. A house painter, he was financially more secure than his father.
Nonetheless he took a mortgage on 9 February 1844 from Charles S. Webb on lot #122 in Richland. Enoch M. agreed to
pay Webb $180 plus interest annually. This mortgage was cancelled 27 December 1844.
By his first wife, Mary Ann Nye he had a son, Enoch born 4 April 1838. This child died after 1850 for no more
is recorded about him.
By 1850 Enoch M. lived in Mexico with his wife, Elizabeth, worshipping at the First Baptist Church of
Mexico. Enoch M. often held church meetings in his home. He was a great friend of the Charles Herring Davis, Samuel C.
J. Greene, Mrs. Abby Morton, Hiram Norton and their families. His great niece, May (Davis) Greene often wrote about him
and his wife in her diary.
On September 2, 1882 his great niece put in her diary, “Pa [Charles H. Davis] called at Uncle Enoch’s this
morning. Thinks he is pretty badly off. Will not live very long at the most.”
Through September the diary recorded various family members going to assist Uncle Enoch and Aunt Eliza.
Enoch M. died 4 October 1882 in Mexico.
His niece recorded, “Uncle Enoch died Wednesday night about 10 o’clock. The funeral is today [October 6] at
2…. Papa Greene [Samuel C.J.] came over after us. Uncle H’s [Hiram Norton] people were all there, but Cora, Alice,
Charlie &amp; Clarence [Norton children]. Nora [Davis] did not go over to the burying ground. Pa [Charles H. Davis] carried
Virgil Douglass and his daughter. Aunt Eliza [Ferris], Mother Greene [Lucena (Smith) Greene], Lula [Davis] rode with
Lyme [Lyman Beecher Smith] and came back with Dear Theodore [Greene].” [The reference to the burying ground likely
meant the Mexico Village Cemetery.]
Elizabeth, his third wife, lived to 24 September 1902 into her 100th year. She was much beloved, the oldest
member of the church when she died which seemed to mark a fitting end for Rev. Enoch’s personal mission in life.
