            <div class="person-text">(1.4.7.7.10.3.6) LUCILE VIOLA LEGGETT (Photo) born February 23, 1885 Highland
Park, Wayne, MI and died January 3, 1976 Los Angeles CA; buried Sashabaw
Cemetery; married (as his second wife) October 4, 1916 in Detroit, Rice Alva Howell
[son of Floyd Parshall &amp; Lucy Ann (Mapes)] born December 30, 1884 White Oaks
Township, Ingham Co MI and died December 10, 1949 Birmingham MI. The occasion
and the author of the following are unknown: Rice Alva Howell, one of the rising young
real estate men of Detroit, who is specializing in the handling of business and industrial
property, born in Ingham County, Michigan, December 30, 1884, and is a son of Floyd
P. and Lucy Ann (Mapes) Howell, who are also natives of Michigan, having spent their
entire lives in this state. The father is a successful farmer of Livingston County. They
became the parents of four children: Rice A., Emmett, who resides in Livingston
County; and Effie, who is the widow of Charles Lyons and resides in the same county.
&quot;After attending the public schools of Fowlerville, Livingston County, Rice A.
Howell pursued a special business course in the Fowlerville High School and when his

textbooks were put aside he entered the department store of W. P. Schenk &amp; Company of
Chelsea, Michigan, there remaining through the succeeding three years. On the
expiration of that period he resigned his position and removed to Seattle, Washington,
where he was employed by the dry goods firm of McDougall, Southwick &amp; Company,
with whom he continued for two years. Returning to Michigan, he located at Detroit and
obtained a position in the dry goodshouse of the Newcomb-Endicott Company, with
which he continued for a year, after which he spent two years in the dry goods house of
Carson Pirie Scott &amp; Company of Chicago. He then came once more to Detroit and
spent a year as an employee of the J. L. Hudson Company. Up to this period of his
business career Mr. Howell had been identified entirely with mercantle lines, and was
convinced that the real estate business offered a greater future. He entered that field of
activity in the employ of the Forsyth &amp; Merry Company. Two years&#x27; connection with
that firm brought him broad experience along real estate lines and he then entered
business on his own account in 1917, since which time he has specialized in the
handling of industrial and business properties. He has sold various factory sites and is
regarded as one of the most successful real estate operators in his city. His thoroughly
reliable business methods and his progressiveness have won for him not only a highclass clientele but as well the commendation of his associates and all with whom he has
been brought in contact through his business relations, which are constantly growing in
volume and importance.
On the 16th of June 1909, in Seattle, Washington, Mr. Howell was married
to Miss Vera Glazier, who passed away in that city on lthe 30th of June 1910. She was a
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Frank P. Glazier, of Chelsea, Michigan, and at her death left
one child, Geraldine Elizabeth, born March 9, 1910, in Seattle, and is attending school in
Detroit. Mr. Howell was married on the 4th of October 1916 to Miss Lucile Leggett,
daughter of Mr. &amp; Mrs. William H. Leggett, of Highland Park, Michigan, and they have
one child JoAnn Virginia, born in Highland Park, Michigan, October 3, 1919.
Mr. Howell belongs to Palestine Lodge, A. F. &amp; A. M., also to the Eastern
Star and to the Detroit Board of Commerce. In his political connection he is a
republican, taking a businessman&#x27;s interest in political affairs. His chief recreation is
found in motoring and gardening. He is interested in all those forces, which make for
development and betterment in the city and gives hearty support to all interests which
are a matter of civic virtue and civic pride.
Since February 1920, Mr. Howell has resided on Southfield Road,
Birmingham, where his residence, Hillside View, is one of the very pleasant homes of
that highly desirable suburban section. Hillside View was formerly known as the Warren

D. Clizbe home and the original semi-colonial type of architecture has not only
intensified but complete modernization of the structure including the addition of a threecar garage, has been carried out by Mr. Howell. The natural elevation of the property,
overlooking Birmingham Park, the Oakland Hills Golf Club and the spring fed water
courses leading to the River Rouge, all Contribute to an attractiveness that only nature
could supply.&quot; Lucile &amp; Rice had three daughters: Barbara, JoAnn Virgina, and
Wilhelmina Winifred. They resided at 588 Southfield, Birmingham, Michigan. A few
years after Rice&#x27;s death, Lucile went to California to live with her daughter Billie in the
fall &amp; winter &amp; back with her daughter JoAnn in the spring &amp; summer. Her daughter
JoAnn then resided in the home at 588 Southfield.</div>
