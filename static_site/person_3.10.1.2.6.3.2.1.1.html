Charles Fletcher Swingle served in various positions (1922–1935) from field assistant to associate pomologist for Nursery
Stock Investigation, Bureau of Plant Industry (B.P.I.), U.S.D.A., performing research in the laboratory, field, and
greenhouse on methods and materials of plant propagation, especially studies on vegetable propagation and fruit tree
understocks. In 1927–28, while a collaborator with the B.P.I., Swingle worked in Leeds, England, with J. H. Priestly and
investigated gardeners’ training schools, horticultural and botanical research agencies, and private nurseries in central
Europe and also served as the U.S. representative to the Eighth International Horticultural Congress, Vienna. In 1928
Swingle and Professor Henri Humbert of the University of Algiers explored Madagascar where they found Euphorbia intisy,
previously believed extinct, as well as other rubber plants, Kalanchoe and other ornamentals, and other plants. From July
1935 to August 1943, Swingle served with the U.S. Soil Conservation Service (S.C.S.). He was horticulturist for the S.C.S.
in Washington, DC (July 1935–August 1939), responsible for the establishment and administration of a nationwide S.C.S.
nursery system. He then became horticulturist and nursery manager for the S.C.S. in Manhattan, Kansas (September 1939–
August 1943), in charge of the routine operation of one of the largest nurseries of the S.C.S. He assisted in tree- and grassseed production, as well as grass-seed collection and research, with the goal of obtaining new crops, especially nuts, plums,
and berries, for use throughout the Great Plains. From November 1943 to June 1945, Swingle served as assistant director of
War Hemp Industries, Inc., Milkweed Floss Division, in Petoskey, Michigan. His objective was to collect milkweed pods
for servicemen’s life jackets, as the kapok supply in the Dutch East Indies had been cut off by the Japanese. Swingle
supervised the nationwide collection of pods by schoolchildren and others and enlisted the cooperation of various
agriculture-related bodies. He spent June 1945 to September 1947 at the Estacion Agricola Experimental, Tingo Maria,
Peru, as Senior Horticulturist, Office of Foreign Agricultural Relations, U.S.D.A. His duties there were to establish and
operate an Amazon Valley experimental station run jointly by the U.S.D.A. and the Peruvian Ministry of Agriculture. The
station’s function was the introduction and testing of both general and tropical plants, including rubber, cinchona, cacao,
banana, citrus, and manioc. Swingle served as extension horticulturist for the University of Wisconsin and the U.S.D.A. at
Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, from December 1947 to January 1950, performing extension work with northeastern Wisconsin
fruit growers, as well as research and some administration of the Peninsular Branch Experiment Station. From 1950 to
1955, he was a commercial strawberry grower in Sturgeon Bay.

‘Dorothy was a corker; cracking jokes all the time and always adding humor to her writings. She was a
great person!’ Dorothy and John apparently had at least one child, a daughter.</div>
