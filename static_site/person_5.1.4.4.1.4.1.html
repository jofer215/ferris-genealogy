HISTORIC CONGRESSIONAL CEMETERY – CROGGON In Old Washington
By James Croggon, The Evening Star, February 25, 1911 [pt. 2 p. 3]
About 1845 James Crutchett bought at the northeast corner of North Capitol and C streets and erected on the summit of the
hill a frame cottage, yet standing as part of the Yznaga home. Mr. Crutchett called the place the Bethesda cottage and it was
set out with trees, flowers and plants. He was the originator of a solar gas which he manufactured on the premises, lighting
his home therewith, and it is believed to have been the first place in the District where gas was used. Regarding his
experiment as a success, he secured an appropriation to light the Capitol building, as well as the grounds, and on the old
dome of the Capitol a mast surmounted by a lantern eighty feet above the dome was used. The light was one of the brightest
ever seen in the District, but for some reason, probably he cost, the project was abandoned and the following year contracts
were made with the recently incorporated gaslight company. In the square east of the above, between Delaware avenue and
1st street east, north of C street, Ephriam French, in the late forties, erected at the southwest corner of the square a threestory building, yet standing there. Mr. French lived there several years, and is well remembered by man older residents for
his work at tile setting in the Capitol. (Is this the same guy?)</div>
