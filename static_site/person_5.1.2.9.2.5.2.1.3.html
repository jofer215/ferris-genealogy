1912, Mr. Townsend purchased an automobile, the first to travel the roads of Kent regularly, with Mr.
Barker being the operator of the vehicle for Mr. Townsend. After a few years, Mr. Barker opened a
Ford garage, which he ran successfully and later added plumbing to his business enterprises. In 1924,

Barker left public life and continued in business. He later went to work at Harlem Valley State
