THOMAS JEFFERSON DARLING. Prominent among the leading lumber manufacturers and dealers of Ware county is
Thomas Jefferson Darling, of Waycross, who was for many years identified with the upbuilding and growth of this section
of the state, and has contributed his full share towards advancing its material interests, as proprietor of the Darling
Construction Company being associated with one of its most valuable industrial enterprises. A son of Dr. Thomas Jackson
Darling, he was born, June 25, 1868, in Blackshear, Pierce County, Georgia, of New England lineage.
His grandfather, Joseph Darling, was born in 1784, either in Rhode Island, or in Georgia, of Rhode Island ancestry. For
many years a resident of Richmond County, Georgia, he owned a large plantation on the Washington road, eight miles from
Augusta, where both he and his wife spent their last years, at the close of life being buried side by side on the old home
plantation, his death occurring October 4, 1844. He married Mary Manning Dunevan, who was born March 5, 1783, and
died April 14, 1847, having survived him two and one-half years.
Born in Richmond County, Georgia, in 1828, Thomas Jackson Darling laid a solid foundation for his future education in the
days of his youth, and was subsequently graduated from the Augusta, Georgia, Medical College with the degree of M. D.
Beginning the practice of medicine in Blackshear. Pierce county, Dr. Darling continued there until the breaking out of the
war between the states, when he offered his services to the Confederacy, and as a surgeon in the Army continued in active
service until the close of the conflict. Resuming then his practice in Blackshear, he remained there until his death, June 14,
1873, being one of the foremost physicians and surgeons of that part of the county.
The maiden name of the wife of Dr. Darling was Bashabee Elizabeth Godbee. She was born in Alabama, July 29, 1829, a
daughter of Samuel Isaac Ivy Godbee, and grand-daughter of Samuel Godbee, who married Elizabeth Moore, a daughter of
Abner Moore. Samuel Isaac Ivy Godbee, who removed from. Alabama to Georgia in 1830, and spent the remainder of his
years in Eichmond county, married Elizabeth Mobley, a daughter of James Alexander and Sarah (Wimberly) Mobley. The
Moores, Mobleys and Wimberlys were among the early and prominent settlers of Richmond County. Dr. Darling&#x27;s wife
outlived him many long years, passing away October 9, 1903, leaving eight children, as follows: Rena, Mina, Dora, Will,
Emma, A. C., Thomas Jefferson, and Edward Lee.
Receiving his preliminary mental training in the public schools of Blackshear, Thomas Jefferson Darling afterwards
continued his studies at the Johnsonville High School. Apprenticing himself &quot;to a firm of builders at the age of seventeen
years, in Orlando, Florida, he remained with his employers three years, and was afterwards foreman of a carpentering gang
for four years, in Blackshear, Georgia, and in Waycross, Embarking then in business on his own account in Waycross, Mr.
Darling built up a patronage that extended throughout southern Georgia, and into Florida, as a contractor and builder, filling
many large contracts. In Jacksonville, Florida, Mr. Darling erected the magnificent Dyal Upchurch office building, and in
Waycross has had the supervision of the building of many of its most substantial and handsome business blocks. He erected
the Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association Building, the Bunn Bell College

Building and many others of note. He has built three court houses, numerous school houses, and hundreds of dwellings in
South Georgia, creations of his brains and hands being in evidence in many places. Retiring from the building industry in
1908, Mr. Darling has since been prosperously employed in the lumber business, having an extensive yard in Waycross, and
a finely equipped planing mill.
On August 8th, 1895, Mr. Darling married Laura Le Count, who was born in Kekoshkee, Wisconsin, May 25, 1868, a
daughter of Charles Le Count, and grand-daughter of John Hendrix Le Count. Her great-grandfather, John Le Count, was
born at New Rochelle, New York, of French Huguenot ancestry, and served, so it is supposed, as a soldier in the
Revolutionary war. John Hendrix Le Count, a native of New Rochelle, New York, served in the War of 1812, and Mrs.
Darling now has in her possession his papers giving him an honorable discharge from the service. He subsequently removed
to Wisconsin, locating at Hartford, where he spent his remaining years. He married Esther Smith, who was born in Dutchess
County, New York, a daughter of Stephen and Deborah (Bashford) Smith, both of
whom were life-long residents of Dutchess County, his birth occurring in 1770, and his death in 1845, while she was born in
1783 and died in 1851.
As a young man Charles Le Count migrated to Wisconsin, and until 1869 was there engaged in the hardware business. In
that year he settled in Nebraska, in York, which was then a frontier town, seventy miles from a railroad. Opening a hardware
store there, he built up a good business, and became prominent in public affairs, serving as treasurer of York county, as
treasurer of the city of York, and as treasurer of the County Agricultural Society, and of seven other organizations of minor
importance. On account of impaired health, Mr. Le Count sold out his Nebraska interests in 1885, and purchased an orange
grove at Anthony, Marion county, Florida, where he lived until 1906. Coming then to Georgia, he resided in Waycross until
his death, in February, 1907.
Mr. Le Count married Jane Amanda Littlefield, who was born, August 20, 1824, in Readsboro, Vermont, a daughter of
Elisha Alvin Littlefield. Her grandfather, Asa Littlefield, who was born May 6, 1762, and died June 19,1845, married,
March 24, 1782, Lois Stark, whose birth occurred May 15, 1755, and who died April 25, 1740. In 1820 Elisha Alvin
Littleneld married Lydia Maria Parsons, a daughter of Joseph and Rachel (Battles) Parsons, who removed from Canada to
Vermont, and they subsequently left New England, going to Kekoshkee, Wisconsin, where both spent their remaining years.
Mr. and Mrs. Charles Le Count were people of sterling worth and integrity, highly esteemed in the business and social
circles of Kekoshkee, and were valued members of the Universalist church. They reared four children, namely: Adelaide,
John, Charles, and Laura, now Mrs. Darling. Mr. and Mrs. Darling are the parents of four children, namely: Thomas Jackson
Darling, Charles Le Count Darling, Dorothea Darling, and Sunshine Darling.
Politically Mr. Darling supports the principles of the Democratic party in state and town elections, and in national affairs is a
Prohibitionist. Religiously both Mr. and Mrs. Darling are members of the Methodist Episcopal church.
