            <div class="person-text">(3.8.1.3) JONAH FERRIS born 1744 Stamford CT and died there December 26, 1815/18; enlisted in
the spring of 1779 in Captain Sylvanus Brown&#x27;s Company, Colonel Matthew&#x27;s Regiment for nine
months, and re-enlisted in the spring of 1780 for one year in Captain Charles Smith&#x27;s Company,
Colonel John Mead&#x27;s Regiment and was wounded; married 1st lady unknown; married 2d December 2,
1784 Anne Smith [daughter of Charles and Elizabeth (Knapp) Smith] born November 23, 1746
Greenwich and died 1844. Jonah was buried in a small cemetery near his home on Erskine Road. His
remains were removed to Long Ridge Cemetery, where a marker has been placed. A question arises as
to whether Jonah was married previous to his marriage to Anne. The 1790 census, when Jonah had
been married to Anne only 6 years, showed Jonah the head of a household of 2 males over 16, 1 under
16 and 4 females. It seems more probable, however, that another family was living in his household.
Anne applied for and received Jonah&#x27;s pension (W25572) in 1840. His will named, as his only heir, his
daughter Mary Ann Hoyt. Born to Jonah and his wives (?), were [may have been another son and
daughter]:</div>
