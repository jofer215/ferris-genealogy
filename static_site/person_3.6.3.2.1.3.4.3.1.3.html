            <div class="person-text">(3.6.3.2.1.3.4.3.1.3) VINCENT F. SMITH (twin) (Photograph) born June 24, 1910, Phillipstown NY

Fishkill schools; married November 30, 1933 in Glendale, Long Island NY, Helen G. K. Hoops (19101967). Vincent was the Town of Poughkeepsie’s first policeman; hired as a special patrolman in
November 1940 at 50 cents a month to check doors in the Arlington business district each night to
make sure they were locked; seriously injured in 1949 when he was struck by a car while directing
traffic; named the Department’s first chief on June 24, 1953 and served for 13 years until his
retirement in September, 1966. From his obituary: He was a big man and stood out in a crowd. When
he was chief, he always insisted that if his men were sent out to handle a complaint, the complainant
had to be satisfied. If he wasn’t, we got chewed out good! He laid down the traditions of the
department. Chief Smith was appointed an honorary life member of the town’s Police Benevolent
Association in 1960 and was a member of the International Association of Chiefs of Police; a member
