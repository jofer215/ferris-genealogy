            <div class="person-text">(1.1.3.1.1.3) JAMES ROYCE FERRIS (Photos) [in some sources he is listed as James
Rogers Ferris, but considering his mother&#x27;s maiden name, one can make the sound
argument that Royce is probably correct. Family believes below obit is wrong – middle
name Royce.] born February 19, 1818 Westfield NJ (?) and died there October 26, 1908;
married March 3, 1847 Harriet Eliza Hawkins [dau of Charles &amp; Elizabeth (Gardiner)
Hawkins] born August 31, 1824 NJ and died August 26, 1914.
The Union County Standard, October 30, 1908: James Randolph Ferris, one of Westfield’s oldest and most respected
citizens, died at his hom on Prospect Street, Monday afternoon. Mr. Ferris had been confined to his bed since last April. Ten
years ago he had had a stroke of apoplexy from which he never fully recovered, and since that time he has taken but little
part in active work. He died very peacefully. The members of his family were at his bedside when the end came. James
Randolph Ferris was born at Peekskill, New York February 19, 1818, at what is known as the old Henry Ward Beecher farm,

which was also the homestead of his father and grandfather. He received his education in the schools of his native town, and
early in life entered the mercantile business. During the war he engaged in the men’s furnishing business in Nashville,
Tennessee, with great success. Returning North he established himself in business in New York City, where he gained the
reputation of being one of the most accurate and capable rating agency experts in the business. Fifty years ago, Mr. Ferris
came to Westfield to spend his summers, and he like the country so well that he bought property on Broad Street, east of the
present site of the First M.E. Church. The land comprised a large farm and extended north to Dudley Avenue. Here Mr.
Ferris built a handsome home, which has since been removed to face Prospect Street. Mr. was always one of Westfield’s
most active nd patriotic citizens. He was a life long Republican, and although he never held office, he took a leading part in
the councils of his party and was a liberal contributor to the party cause. In the early days of Westfield there was no public
meeting place, and Mr. Ferris lead the enterprise which resulted in the building of Aeolian Hall, afterwards known as
Arcanum Hall, which was located at the corner of Broad and Prospect Streets, and was totally destroyed by fire many years
ago. He was also one of the prime movers in the organization of Fairview Cemetery Association, and one of the first
members of the Board of trustees of that association. He likewise took an active part in the development of the Westfield
public schools. Mr. Ferris was a devoutly religious man, and it was to this work that he gave his best efforts. Born in the
Methodist faith, he became actively identified with the local denomination upon his coming to Westfield. He was a trustee
of the church for fifty years, and superintendent of the Sunday school for a number of years being succeeded in that office
by the late Robert Rutherford Sinclair, his personal friend. Mr. Ferris was a liberal contributor to all religious enterprises
particularly those promoted by his own denomination. The Methodist Church still has the record of the services he rendered,
and his name is to be found on the roll of honorary trustees. Mr. Ferris represented the best of our American citizenship, and
will long be remembered as one of the town’s exemplary citizens. He is survived by a widow and two daughters, Mrs. Edgar
R. Pearsall, of Union Place, and Miss Ella Ferris. His children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren live to pay tribute to
the ideals of citizenship and fatherhood which he exemplified in his home. At the special request of Mr. Ferris, the funeral
services were private from his late residence, Wednesday evening at 8 o’clock, the Rev. Dr. Addison W. Hayes, pastor the
First Methodist Episcopal Church, officiating. The pall bearers were his three grandsons, Ferris, James and Chester Pearsall;
his son-in-law Edgar Pearsall, his nephew Joseph Ferris and William S. Hurst. The interment was at Fairview, yesterday
morning.
The Union County Standard, August 28, 1914: Mrs. Harriet E. Ferris, widow of James R. Ferris, died suddenly at her home,
129 Prospect street, on Tuesday morning at 5:30, after a severe attack of acute indigestion which she endured for an hour
and a half. Mrs. Ferris would have been 90 years old next Monday if she had lived. She is survived by two daughters, Mrs.
M. F. Pearsall and Miss Ella Ferris, nine grandchildren and three great grandchildren. Mrs. Ferris was born in New York,
August 31, 1824 and had been a resident of this town for fifty-six years. Her husband died about six years ago. Mrs. Ferris
had resided here since the town was a farming district., the Ferris family owning much of the land along what is now known
as Prospect street, from Broad street to Dudley avenue, the upper part of Prospect street and Ferris place, having been
opened by them. For many years Mrs. Ferris was a member of the First Methodist Church and was one of the most
prominent workers. She was for over forty years president of the Ladies Aid Society of that church. She was also active in
missionary and charitable lines and her effective work in the organizations with which she was affiliated is well
remembered by the older residents of the town. She was one of the charter members of the older circulating library and was
later a trustee of the Westfield Public Library. Mrs. Ferris was always active in movements for the welfare of the town and
only relinquished her work when rheumatism affected her activity. She had all her faculties until the last, was a diligent
reader and bright conversationalist, keeping in close touch with National and State and local events and was deeply
interested in the European War. Her death removes one of the oldest residents of the town and a noted figure from church
and literary work. The funeral will be held this afternoon at 3:30 and will be conducted by Rev. G. Franklin Ream, of the
First Methodist church, assisted by Rev. Dr. C. M. Anderson, of Plainfield, a former pastor of Mrs. Ferris. Interment will be
made in Fairview Cemetery.
