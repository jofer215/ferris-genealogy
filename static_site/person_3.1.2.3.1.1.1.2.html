            <div class="person-text">(3.1.2.3.1.1.1.2) LUCINDA BARTON born November 25, 1832 Elkhart Co IN and died May 2, 1921
Marysville WA; buried there; married September 9, 1855 in Elkhart Co, as his 2d wife George S. Crain
[son of Amariah &amp; Elizabeth (Betsey Hakes) Crain Jr] born July 21, 1820 Montgomery Co NY and

moving to Marysville WA in 1902. These words were written of her: Sister Crain was a life-long
