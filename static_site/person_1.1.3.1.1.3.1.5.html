            <div class="person-text">(1.1.3.1.1.3.1.5) CHESTER BURDICK PEARSALL born August 26, 1888 Westfield,
Union, NJ and died January 21, 1983 Litchfield CT; married May 17, 1919 Roxana
Mabel Pratt born January 18, 1893 Steelton PA and died January 19, 1985 Litchfield CT.
Thanks to Edgar P. Leggett, we have this note from Chester to his sisters: To My Sisters
- Katharine, Helen, Virginia, Eleanor. At the turn of the century, 1900, I was twelve
years of age and aware of responsibilities as become the 5th child in a family of 9. Our
home was unpretentious, yet adequate for our needs. My daily chores included cleaning
of lamp chimneys, trimming the wicks, and keeping kerosene in the several lamps. We
had no gas or electricity. I also was expected to scuttle coal from the lean-to in back of
the kitchen to the sizable kitchen range, which used &quot;pea&quot; coal, and the upstairs hall
stove, a &quot;nut&quot; burning Frank-lin, which would supply some heat upstairs for winter days
when the hall was dressing room for most of us. &#x27;There was no central heating, but we
had a fireplace in the living room, put to good use; also a fireplace in the dining room,
but it was more or less blocked off and was rarely used. The kitchen coal range provided
heat for the adjacent dining room. We three boys, Ferris, James and I, occupied a largish
bedroom above the dining room. Jim and I had the double bed with a mattress that
sagged and gave us considerable trouble at night keeping one another on side. Older
brother Ferris had his own iron frame bed. Water for bathing had to be brought up from
the kitchen; hot water from the big range. We all kept decently clean, using up-stairs
pans or the washtub. Saturday was bath day. We took turns of course, and there was
naturally considerable to-do about it, to cleanse us all. Much later a bathroom was
installed; also a central heating plant supplying heat as needed throughout and wonderful
hot water from the spigot. A contribution to the improvement in the homestead occurred
in 1906 or 1907 for which I take credit. Mother sorely needed better kitchen facilities.
The kitchen was two or three steps down from dining room and the floor was old and
difficult if not impossible to keep clean. Also, the lean-to shed which housed the coal
bins was ram-shackle. I drew up a plan for remodeling the kitchen and dispensing with

the out-shed. In due time it was completed, including town water. I don&#x27;t recall whether
the old kitchen coal range was abandoned at that time in favor of an electric range, but I
believe so. The above recollections are of 112 Ferris Place, formerly Union Place,
Westfield. Now that I, Chester, am the oldest of the Edgar Pearsall tribe, events I may
recall before 1900 antedate my sisters. I hope to have pep enough to recount events prior
to 1900, when our home was with Grandmother and Grandfather Ferris on Broad Street.
But that&#x27;s another story. I&#x27;m sending this recollection to Helen to peruse and perhaps
amend. Helen, please pass it on to Katherine, and then to Virginia, and to Eleanor.
Whether the younger generation is interested in &quot;olden times&quot; is a question. We know a
great deal about our ancestors, back many generations, but our own Grandmother
Pearsall whom I so well remember, has left no trace of her parentage. Presumably she
was a &quot;Morgan&quot;, yet if not mistaken, I hazily recall someone telling me that she was a
VanDerhoeft, or some such Dutch ancestry. In any event, I recall her as one of the finest
of Christian characters, on a par with our own Mother. Whatever betides us, we can and
will be proud of our ancestry, both Ferris and Pearsall lineage. I have not attempted to
recount the many incidents that all five of us will recall more or less vividly. Perhaps
one of my sisters will do this. One reason for this recording is to impress upon me, and
all four of my sisters, plus their children, the change, for better or worse, after seventyodd years in way of life. And it roils me to hear and read about the critical attitude of
much of our citizenry, complaining about this and that, from our President and on down
to the garbage collection. This generation is just spoiled-rotten spoiled-myself not
excluded. Folks have been rudely awakened to the fact that other countries than dear old
U.S.A. have their &quot;druthers&quot; - and money, even the dollar, won&#x27;t buy everything. It&#x27;s just
as well that &quot;Americans&quot; must come to accept the inevitable. If we&#x27;re sound in mind we
will profit by it. As a 6 to 8 year old, I recall that men and. women, mostly from Europe,
came to America with precious little except willing-ness and ability to work for wages;
all to their credit. It paid off - after a generation or two, and for the most part they have
become our esteemed citizens and neighbors. Our democracy has made this possible. I
think all should realize and acknowledge it without &#x27;beefing&quot;, especially those who have
been aided so magnificently by opportunities America has offered. I trust you will accept
this memorabilia in the spirit written, and add a contribution. - Thanks Chester and
Edgar. Born to them were:</div>
