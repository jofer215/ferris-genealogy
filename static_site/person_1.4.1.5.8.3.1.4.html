FERRIS, EDWARD E. Mason Ed Ferris born to Ora (Sherd) and Harry Ferris on August 29, 1909 at
the family farm in Onondaga, MI. He was the only son of five children. His sisters were Helen
(Barnes), Lucielle (Mangles), Harriett (Leach) and Frances (Hamling). After graduation from Eaton
Rapids High School, he attended and graduated from Tri-State College in Indiana with a degree in Civil
Engineering. He worked his way through school as a ranger at Glacier National Park in Montana. It
was here that he met his life-time sweetheart, Ruth (Salo) Ferris. They were married for 64 years and of
that union came Betty (Sprague) Ferris and Richard Ferris. With their children, they moved back to
Mason, MI, where he became Ingham County Road Commissioner and later started his own road
building business, The Ferris Company. With his interests in engineering and as an inventor, his
entrepreneurial skills led to land development in Florida. He also dabbled in prospecting and mining. A
life long resident of Mason, MI, he built a log cabin on the east side of town where he resided with his
family for over 50 years. He dedicated his life to family and community. With his children and
grandchildren, Markus, Scott and Craig Held, he farmed the land he grew up on, and developed an
organic grain and bean business and Health Food Distribution business (Harvest Time) where he
worked until 3 weeks prior to his death. He also has a grandson through his son Richard, Nicholas. He
was committed to his faith as he exercised his dedication to God in his daily life and as Deacon of his
Church. He was preceded in death by his parents, sisters, Lucielle and Helen and most recently his
wife, Ruth. Funeral services will be held Wednesday, January 16, 2 p.m. at the Gorsline-Runciman Co.
