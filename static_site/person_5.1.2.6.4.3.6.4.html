            <div class="person-text">(5.1.2.6.4.3.6.4) ABRAHAM LINCOLN FERRIS (Lincoln Abraham Ferris) born October 10, 1867
Blenheim (?) NY; a Methodist minister with churches in Santa Barbara and San Diego CA; married
June 7, 1894 Lillian O’Donnell – he remarried later in life and was quite famous in California as a
preacher of great oratorical skill; as a Methodist minister he deemed it blasphemous to have Abraham
as a first name, or so the family legend goes, and changed it to Lincoln Abraham Ferris.
From Laurel Ferris: Here is the only references` I found in Lincoln A. Ferris&#x27;s sermons to his father and mother. I thought
you might be interested in them (embellished as they appear) since the same parents raised GWG Ferris.
&quot;In the gray of an October day, long years ago, there came to my hand a telegram, from the publishers for whom I had
worked saying: &#x27;Perkins, of Chicago, is sick. Would you like to take the branch office. Will contract for four years at
$6,000.00 a year, and give you the bonus of the office. Worth last year $7,800.00 to Perkins. Ought to be worth $10,000.00
to you. Wire us when you will go.&#x27; In the same thirty minutes there came a letter from the Presiding Elder, Alfred Coons, of
Kingston District, New York Conference, saying: &#x27;I understand you have some months, before entering the Theological

Seminary. Would like you to supply the Livingstonville charge until the close of the Conference year. You will have lots of
hard work, a good deal of experience, and only God in heaven knows if you will ever get any pay. Write me if it is possible
for you to go.&#x27; I gave the messages into my father&#x27;s hands, he being a &#x27;preacher man&#x27; and asked him what to do. His eyes
filled with mist as he gave them back, saying: &#x27;My son, you will need to speak to your Heavenly Father about so important a
matter as this.&#x27; And a lad climbed the stairs and after two hours came again and sent a telegram, saying: &#x27;Impossible to go to
Chicago.&#x27; And another saying: &#x27;Will leave for Livingstonville two weeks from today.&quot; &quot;I am the plainest sort of man and far
removed from the poet&#x27;s hear, yet I journeyed four hundred and fifty miles to walk down a path not longer than the aisle of a
church, where, as a boy of seven, I walked on even-tide with my poet mother; and I remember saying: &#x27;Mama, why does the
mountain ash flower in the drops of blood?&#x27; And my mother said, &#x27;The mountain ash is far from home. Its friends are far
away on the mountains and maybe God lets it blossom in red so it can say to them, &#x27;I love you and i remember, and my heart
is always with you in the hills.&#x27; The grasses are long since green above the grave of my mother. The mountain ash no longer
flames in red and the roses have died beside the walk, but they still cast their shadows in my heart.&quot;
November 30, 1917, San Diego Union, 7:3. Union services drew many to park; Dr. Lincoln A. Ferris, pastor of First
Methodist Episcopal Church, delivered Thanksgiving address; impressive musical program; soldiers and sailors acted as
usher and took up a collection for the benefit of the poor by the Associated Charities of San Diego.
