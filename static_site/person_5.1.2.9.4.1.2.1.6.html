            <div class="person-text">(5.1.2.9.4.1.2.1.6) EDNA MAE CROOKSTON born July 12, 1888 Cold Spring, NY and died April 29,
1949 at the Presbyterian Medical Center, New York; buried Raymond Hill Cemetery; married 1910 at
Ludingtonville Baptist parsonage, Bert Lafayette Smith “Bertie” [son of Lafayette G. &amp; Emma A.
(Mead)] born September 9, 1883 East Fishkill, NY and died February 21, 1943 Carmel NY; both
buried Raymond Hill cemetery, Carmel NY. Bert attended the rural schools in East Fishkill and was an

apt pupil, specializing in arithmetic. Those who remember him as a young man, remember that he was
noted for kindness, honesty and sterling qualities. To know him was to know a staunch and devoted
friend. Bert followed farming as an occupation and they resided on various farms in the towns of
Patterson and Kent for several years. He was a farmer nearly all his life and was on several large milk
farms in Dutchess and Putnam counties in his younger years and had been employed by the County
Highway department. Edna had been employed as a nurse at the Harlem Valley State hospital for
several years and she was a member of the Mt. Carmel Baptist church - apparently no offspring</div>
