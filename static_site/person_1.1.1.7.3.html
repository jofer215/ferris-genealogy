            <div class="person-text">(1.1.1.7.3) ISAAC FERRIS, LL.D., (Photograph) born October (July?) 9, 1798 New
York City and died June 16, 1873 Roselle NJ. He was the third Chancellor, University of
New York City from 1852-70. Early in the seventeenth century John Ferris coming from
Leicestershire, England, settled in Fairfield, Connecticut, and later became one of the
proprietors of Throckmorton&#x27;s Neck, in Westchester County, New York. His great
grandson, Captain John Ferris, was the father of Isaac Ferris, born in the City of New
York, on the 9th day of October 1798. Isaac&#x27;s father, a poor man with a large family to of
children, could do little to educate him, but Isaac traded a pair of skates for a Latin
grammar and he was prepared for college by the celebrated blind classical teacher,
Professor Nelson. He entered Columbia when but twelve years of age, joined the
military company raised among the students in the war of 1812 and did duty in the forts
around New York harbor. His college course was delayed one year by this, and he was

graduated from Columbia College in the class of 1816, with the highest honors of his
class; having as classmates Frederick de Peyster, John Ireland, James W. Eastburn and
Richard Codman. He immediately became Instructor in Latin in the Albany Academy
where he taught for one year, and then studied theology under Dr. James M. Mason.
Deciding to devote himself to the ministry, he entered the Theological Seminary,
graduating in 1820. After a short time spent as a missionary in the Mohawk Valley, he
was offered a position in the Theological Seminary to succeed Dr. John M. Mason, but
instead accepted a call to the pastorate of the Reformed Dutch Church, at New
Brunswick, N.J. in 1821. In 1822 he was elected a Trustee of Queen&#x27;s, now Rutgers
College. In October, 1824, he became pastor of the Middle Dutch Church at Albany, and
continued there until 1836, and then was called to the Market street church, New York in
1836-53, then the most fashionable church in the old 7th Ward of New York City. In
1833, he received the degree of D.D. from Union College, and in 1853, that of LL.D.
from Columbia College. He went to Holland as commissioner on behalf of American
missionaries in the Dutch East Indies in 1842. He was long connected with the Sundayschool union, was president of the city organization from 1837 till 1873. Dr. Ferris was
one of the corporate members of the American Board of Foreign Missions. As its first
corresponding secretary he did much to further its work in India, China, and Japan. The
large girls&#x27; school in Yokohama (founded by Mary Kidder) was named Ferris Seminary
in his honor (opened in 1875) and still operates today as the Ferris Girls’ School (Photo).
In 1840, he became connected with the American Bible Society. Dr. Ferris was largely
instrumental in organizing the Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association of New York. Rutgers
Female Seminary, later Rutgers Female College, one of the first institutions to afford
higher education for women, was planned and established by Dr. Ferris and for a long
period was its principal and the president of its board of trustees for 18 years, and was
subsequently connected with the Ferris institute. In 1852, by unanimous vote, he was
chosen Chancellor of the University of New York. He found the University at the lowest
possible ebb, without a chancellor for two years, overwhelmed with debt, with no
means, and a mere handful of students. With his rare executive ability and by great
personal effort, he collected about $74,000 outside of the rentals and other receipts of
the university, and thus, he put the college on its feet, paid its debts, secured for it a
liberal endowment, and left it a prosperous institution. He filled the chair of moral
science and Christian evidence during his whole connection with the university, and was
also acting professor of constitutional and international law in 1855-69. He published
numerous occasional sermons, essays, and addresses, including &quot;Appeal to the Ministers
in behalf of Sunday-Schools&quot; (Philadelphia, 1834), and a &quot;Report on Separate Action in

Foreign Missions&quot; (1857).In 1870, Dr. Ferris retired from active duty at the University,
and became Chancellor Emeritus. He removed to Roselle, N.J., where he ended an
active and useful life on the 16th of June, 1873. Dr. Ferris was tall, of very large frame,
and great dignity of manner. He was a man of great benevolence and amiability. In his
intercourse with his parishioners, he was genial and sympathetic. He was eminent as a
scholar, and of untiring industry, and was much beloved by all who knew him. On
December 30, 1820 Isaac married Catharine Ann Burchan [dau of Robert &amp; Catherine
(Ward) Burchan] born May 18, 1801 and died September 9, 1837; married second
February 28, 1839 Sarah Jane Crygier born November 28, 1811 and died July 2, 1848;
married third October 1, 1850 Letitia Storm born October 21, 1822 and died February 4,
1902. Among them they bore him thirteeen children. At Albany his unflinching devotion
to the sick and dying of all creeds during the cholera epidemic of 1832 was remembered
with gratitude forty years after the event. Rev. Ferris was a minister that was associated
with several settlements; besides serving St. Paul&#x27;s of Manheim, he served Danube,
Oppenhim and Herkimer, going from one to the other on horseback. From The New York
Times, November 10, 1894: &quot;A suit brought by Letitia S. Ferris, the widow of
Chancellor Isaac Ferris of the University of the City of New York, who died in June
1873, to set aside a release of dower in the property of her husband, has been dismissed
by Justice Ingraham of the Supreme Court. The Chancellor’s son, Richard B. Ferris, the
Vice President of the Bank of New York, managed the estate. Included in the property
was a residence at Roselle NJ, which the widow received, and the house 108 East
Twelfth Street. The release which the widow signed was executed Dec 23, 1873. She
claims that she signed it under a misapprehension as to its contents, that she was not
aware that it was a release of dower and that the procurement of it was fraudulent.
Justice Ingraham holds that there is no evidence of any attempt to force her to execute
the release, and he says that her claim to dower in the real estate in this city would defeat
the expressed intentions of her husband and would be inconsistent with the provisions of
the will. The two unmarried daughters, Charlotte and Sarah, under the terms of the will
received an equal interest in the use of or rents of the house 108 East Twelfth Street.&quot;
Born Isaac and Catherine were [a daughter whom died the same day she born, in 1821,
is not included below; plus a son born in 1828 and died 5 weeks later]:</div>
