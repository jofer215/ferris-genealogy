            <div class="person-text">(1.4.1.5.7) WATSON FERRIS (CAPTAIN) born July 28, 1804 and died July 18, 1853
of Chagres Fever on Isthmus of Panama; it is said his body was placed in a barrel of rum
and is according to Bronx historian John McNamara in the “family vault behind
Westchester Square”, in the Ferris Cemtery (Ferris Family Plot, aka Pasture Hill)
established early 1700s along Commerce Avenue near Westchester Ave, Bronx NY. He
was Commander of the ship Westchester sailing from San Francisco for New York City.

(Jim - brief research shows that many people from the East went by ship to Panama, en
route to the California goldfields and vice versa. They would take a boat from say
Boston to Panama, then go up the Chagres River by native canoe, then overland by mule
and foot; remember now this was before the Panama Canal was built. The following
was sent to me by Dennis Bell - thanks, Dennis!
Watson Ferris (born July 28, 1804 Westchester, New York died July 18, 1853) of malaria
on the Isthmus of Panama. LDS Film #1760837, LDS Batch #8680905. He married
Sarah Ward. Ships under the command of Captain Watson Ferris brought literally
thousands of Irish emigrants across the Atlantic to the United States in the middle of the
19th century at the height of the Irish Potato Famine. Ferris was master of
the Westchester from at least March, 1837 until April, 1842. On his last voyage aboard
the Westchester, the 38-year-old skipper affirmed the following cargo manifest on his
arrival from Liverpool in New York on April 4: AI, Watson Ferris, master of Ship
Westchester do solemnly, sincerely, and truly affirm that the following List or Manifest,
subscribed by me, and now delivered by me to the Collector of the Customs of the
Collections District of New York, is a full and perfect list of all the passengers taken on
board of said Westchester at Liverpool, England. from which Port said Ship has now
arrived; and that on the said list is
truly designated the age, the sex, and the occupation of each during the passage, the
country to which each belongs, and also the country to which it is intended by each to
become an inhabitant.
So help me God. (signed) Watson Ferris. Sworn before me this April 4, 1842 (signed)
M.L. Davis.@
Ferris was master of the 845-ton St. George from at least February, 1844 until August,
1848 -- passenger manifests also survive for 13 voyages of that vessel from Liverpool
to New York under his command. Talented mariners often received their first command
in their late 20&#x27;s, so it is possible that the Westchester was not Ferris&#x27;s earliest ship. The
captain may also have made a couple of voyages from England to Tasmania early in his
career in 1838 as master of the Neptune III, transporting prisoners from England to exile
in Tasmania. The skipper of that vessel is listed as W.J. Ferris, but no further details are
provided.
His last command was a medium clipper ship named the John Stuart built by Perrine,
Patterson &amp; Stack of Williamsburg, New York, for Benjamin A. Mumford, James Smith,
et al., and launched in 1851. Her first certificate of registry was issued in New York on
Oct. 27, 1851. According to Octavius T. Howe and Frederick G. Matthews writing in

their book American Clipper Ships, the John Stuart carried above the skysail a main
moonsail, a cloud-cleaner, a stargazer, a sky-scraper, and an angel&#x27;s footstool, &quot;the latter,
however, being set only in dead calms, when the watch on deck were not allowed to
cough or sneeze for fear of carrying it away.&quot; Ferris was her original captain, and he
sailed her on the New York-Liverpool route for her maiden voyage, clearing New York
on Oct. 31, 1851. He was then commissioned to sail her her to San Francisco via Cape
Horn on the tip of South America at the end of 1852, probably as a result of the huge
increase in traffic to the West Coast generated by the California gold rush of 1849. The
John Stuart cleared New York Dec. 17, 1852, and arrived at San Francisco on May 4,
1853, after a comparatively fast voyage of 136 days. The clipper ship then cleared San
Francisco bound for Callao, Peru on May 31, 1853, under the command of A. V. A.
Townsend. Ferris took a month off in San Francisco then booked passage south to
Panama as a passenger aboard the Pacific Mail Steamship Company’s Golden Gate,
which cleared San Francisco on June 15, 1853. The Golden Gate was a 2,076-ton
wooden side-wheel steamship, 262 feet in length, with two funnels, three masts and
three decks, built in New York by William H. Webb (hull #56), for the Pacific Mail
Steamship Co., and launched Jan. 21, 1851. Her maiden voyage, on Aug. 2, 1851, took
her from New York around the Horn to Panama, where she began regular service
between Panama and San Francisco, arriving there for the first time on Nov. 19, 1851.
That voyage of 11 days and four hours stood as a record until 1855. She was a very fast,
but very unlucky vessel. In 1852 an outbreak of cholera claimed 84 lives among her
passengers and crew. She had several close calls with other ships. Finally, on July 27,
1862, her engine room caught fire about 15 miles off Manzanillo, Mexico and she sank
just off a beach now known as Playa de Oro and broke up in the surf as her skipper tried
to run her aground. Between 175 and 223 people were killed, and about $1.4 million in
cargo was lost, including $300,000 in bullion from the California goldfields. The gold
was recovered a few months later by a salvage crew from another Pacific Mail
steamship, but the rest of the cargo was lost. Watson Ferris was also a victim of the
Golden Gate’s run of bad luck. He boarded her planning to return to New York via the
Isthmian route, across Panama by riverboat and railroad to Aspinwall, then north to New
York aboard the U.S. Mail Steamship Company’s Illinois, which sailed July 3 and
arrived in New York on July 11, 1853. Captain Ferris apparently became sick aboard the
Golden Gate and made it as far as Aspinwall, where he was hospitalized, by then
critically ill with what was officially listed as Chagres Fever, the local name for malaria,
spread by mosquitos breeding in Panama’s legendary Chagres River. Work began on the
Panama Railroad along the swampy Chagres banks in 1847. William Henry Aspinwall, a

New York merchant, raised eyebrows by setting out to build a railroad across the
Isthmus and combine sea and land routes into one great system that would open up the
whole Pacific. The railroaders chose Manzanillo Island, a square mile of virgin
mangrove swamp, as the Atlantic terminus, and transformed it into what eventually
became the city of Colon.The project killed thousands of men. The construction
workforce was drawn from the four corners of the earth -- England, France, Ireland,
Germany, Austria, China, India, Jamaica, Colombia.Approximately 12,000 rail workers
died of malaria, yellow fever, or the other hardships ofjungle life and work. The new
line played its part in the California Gold Rush, though in 1851 after 20 months of labor
the rails reached only eight miles into the jungle at Gatun. The mighty Chagres River or
Rio Chagres is 300 feet wide in places and sometimes rose 40 feet overnight in storm
season. Now, thanks to the Panama Canal, it is the only river in the world that drains into
the Atlantic and the Pacific both. By late 1853 it had been spanned by a 625-foot,
six-span bridge of boiler iron. And on went the railroad, until in 1855 it went from coast
to coast, 47.51 miles over bottomless swamps and through near impenetrable jungle,
until finally it neared the sparkling cathedral towers of Panama City on the Pacific side
of the isthmus. Ferris succumbed to Chagres Fever in Aspinwall on July 18, ten days
after the Illinois sailed without him. It is not known when or where he contracted the
disease. He was in southern climes intermittently for years before his final trip across the
Isthmus, and the malaria may have been a recurring affliction of increasing severity. But
then, the cure was undiscovered. His body is believed to have been brought home by
another U.S. Mail steamship, the Georgia, which arrived in New York Friday, July 29,
1853 after a nine-day voyage from Aspinwall. He was survived in New York by his wife
Sarah Ward and five children -- a son and four daughters. The New York Tribune
published the following obituary notice in its Monday, Aug. 1, 1853 editions: AFerris At Aspinwall, on the 18th, of fever, Captain Watson Ferris, late of the ship JOHN
STUART. His remains will be interred this day, (Monday) at 2 1/2 o=clock PM, from
the residence of his brother James, on Throg’s Neck, Westchester. Friends wishing to
attend will take their cars from the City Hall at 11 1/2 o=clock for Williams Bridge,
where they will find a conveyance to take them to the house.@ At long last, Watson
Ferris was finally home forever. The U.S. Maritime Commission must have considered
Watson Ferris a sailor of considerable repute. During the Second World War, the
commission had an auxiliary ship built for the merchant marine that was christened the
Watson Ferris in his honor. The vessel survived the war, but what became of the Ferris is
unknown. And what became of the clipper ship John Stuart is also unknown. It has been
determined that she was still sailing at the outbreak of the U.S. Civil War. Under Captain

Bernsee, the vessel left New York on Dec. 21, 1859 and arrived in San Francisco April
23, 1860, a very respectable 123-day voyage around the horn, but a long way from the
record, set five years earlier by the Flying Cloud. In early 1854 Cloud covered the route
anchor to anchor in 89 days and eight hours, the fastest time ever recorded for a sailing
ship. Born to Watson and Sarah Ward were:</div>
