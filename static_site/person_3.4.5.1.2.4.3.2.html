            <div class="person-text">(3.4.5.1.2.4.3.2) HELEN MARIA FERRIS (1850-) married 1879 John Gould, of Aurora, Portage, OH
[son of John W. &amp; Eliza (Post)] born 1844 Twinsburg OH; led much the life of any farmer’s son going
to township schools, and for several winters was under the tutorship of the Rev. Graves; being a very
studious turn of mind, he added to his limited school advantages a general fund of information gleaned
from an extended reading of books, magazines, and the best papers. In 1870 he became connected with
the Cleveland Herald and in 1873 was advanced to the position of traveling agent of the paper. The year
following he became a staff correspondent, and in that position made extended tours, his travels in one
year taking him into nearly a score of states. When the temperance movement began, he was delegated
his paper to report it, and for over 3 months this was his exclusive duty. When he married Helen, he
gave up journalism and they located to Aurora Station OH and John began farming, but in 1880, upon
the reorganization of the editorial staff of the Herald, he again became connected with the editorial
force of that paper, with special assignment to its agricultural department. The same year, he became
dairy editor of the Ohio Farmer, and for years his writings for that journal over the pseudonym of
“Sam”, were widely read. When Secretary Chamberlain, of Columbus, organized the lecture course
known as “Farmers’ Institutes”, John was early assigned to a prominent place as a special lecturer upon
dairy and kindred subjects, and during the winters of 1882-83 and 1884, he visited nearly every part of
the State in that capacity. He wrote articles for the New York Tribune, Rural New Yorker, County
Gentleman, Coleman’s Rural, Prairie Farmer, etc. When the Herald folded in 1885, John accepted a
position on the editoral staff of the Cleveland Plain Dealer; apparently no offspring</div>
