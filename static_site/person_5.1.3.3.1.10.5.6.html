            <div class="person-text">(5.1.3.3.1.10.5.6) AUGUSTUS LUCKEY FERRIS (Photographs) born March 13, 1866 Elliston,
Ottawa, OH and died July 22, 1934 Ness City KS; buried Memorial Park Cemetery. Known in his
family as ‘Gus’ and in his professional career as ‘A.L’. Like others of his family, he was a great lover
of books and he always carried one in his pocket, improving every leisure moment. In his boyhood he
worked on the farm in summer and attended district school in the winter, making the most of his time
in and out of school, and by reading and study fitted himself for the profession of teaching, holding a
three-certificate in Ottawa County. At the age of 20, he commenced teaching in the county, and after
three years of teaching learned telegraphy, at which he worked for several years. In 1892, he returned to
his profession, accepting a position as principal of the Graytown Schools. He married, September 15,
1892 in Ottawa County OH, Maria (Mary) Eisenmann, of Graytown, who died November 9, 1954.
Both are buried in the Memorial Park Cemetery, Lawrence KS. He studied law under the extension
division of the University of Michigan and then attended Valparaiso U. Law School, where he received
his law degree. After graduation, in 1897, and admission to the Ohio Bar, he made his journey by
bicycle from Ohio to Topeka KS, where his Uncle Lewis Ferris, lived. From there he went to western
Kansas where his brothers, Ezekial and Asa, had homesteaded, and settled in Dighton KS. For a time,
he worked for the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad as an attorney in checking titles and
purchasing rights-of-way for the line being built through Kansas and on to Los Angeles; served as
County Attorney in Lane County and later, for several terms, in Ness County. During his tenure in Ness
County, many bootleggers were brought to justice and punished. During WWI, Augustus volunteered
to serve with the YMCA Corps in France, giving aid to soldiers in personal affairs and ministering to
them. He suffered pneumonia from exposure, but recovered and was able to remain in France, and
brought his wounded son, Harold, back home six months after the War ended. During his law career,
Augustus was a long time adult Sunday School teacher and active in civic affairs. Born to them were:</div>
