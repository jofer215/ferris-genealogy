            <div class="person-text">(5.1.3.8.6.3.7) PHEBE ANNIE FERRIS, M. D., born December 5, 1869 DeWitt NY and died August
22, 1945 Los Angeles CA; unmarried; after her father&#x27;s death in 1898, Phebe entered the Medical
College of Syracuse U. and received her M. D., 1902; did intern work in the New England Hospital for
Women and Children in Boston and in 1905 opened offices in Butte MT, where she built up a
successful practice. Always interested in the work of Foreign Missions, in 1917, she accepted an urgent
request from the Methodist Women&#x27;s Foreign Missionary Society to take charge of the Mrs. William
Butler Memorial Hospital in Baroda, India. After a year&#x27;s preparation taking courses in tropical
diseases and surgery at John Hopkins in Baltimore, and studying the Gugahrati language, she sailed for
India in 1918 with one trained nurse. During her 12 years at Baroda, besides ministering to the sick, she
established a nurses training for the native girls, supervised the building of a nurses home and in many
ways greatly advanced the usefulness of the hospital. She retired in 1931 and resided with her brother,
Charles, in Los Angeles.</div>
