            <div class="person-text">(3.1.2.1.11.9.5) DANIEL OSTRANDER FERRIS born March 15, 1837 (1833?) New Rochelle (New
Hamburg) NY and was stricken and died November 15, 1896 in his pulpit in the Summerfield Church,
Bridgeport CT.; buried at Wakefield MA; married 1st April 21, 1858 at Stillwater NY, Frances E. Dakin
(1833-1883) [dau of Hiram and Jane Ann (Thompson) Dakin]; 2d 1885 widow Eleanor N. (Gibson)
Mott (1861-1887); and 3d 1888/89 at Martha&#x27;s Vineyard MA, Ella C. (Perkins) Bragg born June 13,
1852 Wakefield MA and died 1943 Quaketown PA and is buried in a private graveyard behind her
house in the woods at Gold Hill; widow of Rev. Lorenzo Bragg, who bought with her to this marriage,
2 daughters: Mary Pearle who was an international concert singer; and Fannie Greye, a mystery writer
in the Roaring Twenties. Daniel was a Methodist minister of the East Conference; was a Chaplain of
the 133d New York Infantry Regiment (2d Regiment Metropolitan Guard) in the Civil War, resigning
May 9, 1863. The 133d was organized at New York City, September, 24, 1862 and left the state for
Washington, D.C., October 8, 1862; performed duties in the defenses of Washington, D. C. until
November, 1862, when it moved to New Orleans LA; participated in the occupation of Baton Rouge

LA December 17, 1862 and remained on duty there, until March, 1863. He was a ‘forceful and
interesting speaker’ and was ‘well known in Brooklyn and throughout Long Island’. It is said he
preached the sermon at the dedication of Grant’s Tomb. He served the following churches on Long
Island among others: Sag Harbor, Huntington, Hempstead, Amityville, North Amityville, Bay Shore
and Northport and these in Brooklyn: DeKalb Avenue (1868-70), Washington Avenue (1878-79) and
South Second Street (1885-87).
Brooklyn Eagle: The Rev. D. O. Ferris, of the South Second street M. E. Church, has in his procession a cane once owned
by Francis Ashbury, the first bishop of Methodism in this country. The can was presented to Mr. Ferris’ grandfather, the Rev.
Daniel Ostrander, by the bishop in 1812. It is of bamboo wood, with a deer’s horn handle. Mr. Ostrander was the first
presiding elder in the Eastern States under Bishop Ashbury and the two pioneer Methodists were warm friends. Mr. Ferris
has hanging in his study the likeness of his grandfather, who spent fifty-one years of his life in the ministry, and directly
opposite the picture of his diploma. Directly below are the picture and diploma of his father, who occupied the pulpit for
forty-seven years, and below this are his own picture and diploma, showing that he himself has already served for twentysix years. Thus the three generations have preached the Gospel for over a century. Tradition has handed down to Mr. Ferris,
through the family, much valuable knowledge concerning the early struggles of Methodism in America, beside many
valuable relics. Mr. Ferris is at present the pastor of the oldest ecclesiastical Methodist organization in Brooklyn, which was
organized in 1806. He will continue to serve them as an efficient pastor for the next three years.
Brooklyn Eagle, September 20, 1869: A large congregation assembled at the DeKalb avenue M.E. Church yesterday
morning, when, pursuant to announcement, Rev. D.O. Ferris, the pastor, delivered a sermon entitled “The Foolishness of
Preaching.” The discourse was delivered in an eloquent manner, and from the close attention of the listeners and many signs
of approval evinced, must be deemed to have been entirely satisfactory to the auditory. After the usual preliminary religious
exercises were gone through with, and reminding the members of the fact that Rev. Mathew Hale Smith would lecture for
them on “Wit and Humor” on Tuesday evening next for the benefit of the Sabbath-school, Mr. Ferris proceded with his
sermon, which was from Luke VIII, 18th verse. “Take heed, therefore, how ye year.” He said: “It is very necessary that all
people should hear the Word of God preached; not only should they read the Bible at home, but they should attend regularly
the house of God. It is not deemed sufficient for our children’s knowledge of the Bible and religion to put a text book in
their hands and bid them study it; they must be sent to the Sabbath-school where they may hear the truths and beauties of
religion from the lips of loving and competent teachers who will explain all and guide them in the way of the Lord. It is a
great sin not to listen to the preached word; it is expected and required of us, as Christians, to take heed how we hear. What
constitutes a preacher? Is it one who understands the dead languages, and can read the Scriptures in their original tongue? Is
it an eloquent man? It is one who has the spirit and fear of God in his heart. Christ came into the world not only to perish
but to preach also, that those who listened might be saved. To listen is better than to preach; to listen and take heed how ye
heed. There are several classes of listeners: the first, the careless listener who goes to church because everybody else does.
He goes, as he would to a lecture, to get the good points, and looks out for any witty saying which may fall from the lips of
the preacher. Sometimes he considers the confortably upholstered seats none too good to take a nap in, and the speaker’s
voice drones him peacefully to sleep. He goes not for the good he may acquire, and years pass by and find him still
unbenefited. Then there is the captious listener, who goes only to find fault, who is never satisfied with anything; Brother A
speaks too low, too loud, too fast, too slow, is stupid, uninteresting; why don’t he wake up? Then again he’s too boisterous.
On Monday morning he will call and express himself as being not entirely satisfied with the sermon yesterday; it was not
according to his views exactly, and if Brother A wouldn’t mind-and God help poor Brother A., he has to take it. There is no
class of professional men who are so much critized as ministers. A lawyer may say what he likes in court and nobody thinks
of disputing him and this is where the critical listener plays his part. The critical listener is still worse than the captious
listener, because he hears only the words and not the sense of the preaching, and woe be unto the preacher who slips on his
verbs, adjectives and adverbs; he can expect no mercy, for this listener feels the necessity of picking the slightest warp
which projects in the cloth of the preacher’s making, and draws it out, thus leaving a hole, and all the good which might
otherwise have resulted from the pastor’s efforts in lost in order that he may sustain his reputation as a critic. There are some
people who, if an angel were to come down from Heaven and stand in the pulpit before them, would find fault with the set
of his wings. Think you, would a condemned prisoner criticize the wording of the pardon which was sent him at the last
moment?” In the course of his remarks, Mr. Ferris gave an able defense of the ministry, and drew his conclusions on the

above in an able and effective manner. A collection was then taken up in aid of the Society for the Extension of the Gospel,
a hymn and prayer followed, when the congregation was dismissed with the benediction.
Brooklyn Eagle, November 18, 1896: Bay Shore, L.I. – The Rev. Dr. Daniel O Ferris, father of Mrs. Dr. Hulse of this place,
dropped dead in his pulpit in the Summerfield M. E. Church at Bridgeport, Conn, Sunday night. He had not been well for
some time and his death was due to heart disease. Dr. Ferris was one of the best known preachers in the Methodist
denomination and was formerly pastor of the Methodist Episcopal church here. He entered the New York conference in
1858 and was stationed at Morrisania. In 1859 he went to New Hamburg, in 1860 to Putnam Valley. In 1862-2-3 he was a
chaplain in the United States Army. At the end of his service he returned and joined the New York East conference, being
sent in 1864 to Sag Harbor, L.I. and in 1865 to Huntington and in 1866-7 to Hempstead. In 1868-9-70 he was pastor of the
DeKalb avenue M.E. church in this city and in 1871-2-3 was stationed at Waterbury, Conn. In 1874-5-6 he was at
Bridgeport at the First church; in 1877 at Beekman Hill church in New York; 1878-9 at Washington street church, this city;
1880, Bristol, Conn; 1881, Amityville and North Amityville; 1882-3-4, Bay Shore; 1885-6-7, South Second street church,
this city; 1888, Cornell Memorial church, New York City; 1889-90, Sea Cliff; 1891, Northport. In 1892, Dr Ferris went to
the Summerfield church in Bridgeport, in the pulpit of which he died. Dr Ferris’ daughter is the wife of Dr. Hulse of Bay
Shore.
