(3.1.1.1.4.6.3.1.1.5.2) CLIFFORD MARSHALL WILLIAMS (‘Kick’) (‘Ike’) (Photograph) born
January 13, 1919 Champaign Co OH and died August 9, 1991 West Liberty OH; buried at Fairview
Cemetery; a carpenter; a WWII Veteran. On October 23, 1945, from Munich, Germany, ‘Kick’ wrote
his parents: “Dear Folks, Received your letter of October 6th, very glad to hear from you and to hear
that Carl has finally made it home. Maybe it won’t be too long before all of us boys will be back
again. George should be home most anytime now, but I don’t think I will make it before sometime in
December. I don’t know about Stubby, I wonder how he stands for points. I guess he will be getting
out before long though. The days and weeks are long for me now, since I have nothing to do except sit
around and wait to come home. If I wanted to work I could make a good rating now, but I told them I
hadn’t worked since the day the war was over and I didn’t expect to start now. So I don’t do anything.
Ask Carl if he wasn’t stationed here somewhere near Munich? I’m sure he was here in S. Germany.
Ask him if he was ever to the Dachau concentration camp. I am stationed about a mile down the road
from there. You have probably read and heard a lot about the camp. And maybe its hard to believe, but
after you once see how they murdered all the people and still see some of the bodies they are digging
up, there’s not much question about it. There was supposed to have been 3000 prisoners killed by
medical experiments and 5000 Jews died from hanging, gas, and firing squads. I expect Carl has told
you about it. Have you been having squirrel to eat? It will soon be time for rabbits and bird too. I
hope I can make it home in time to do a little hunting, but don’t believe I will. We have hunting trips
down here, mostly for deer, there’s lots of them over here, but their only about 1/3 as big as those in the
States. I haven’t been on any of the trips yet. Well heres hoping that you are all well. And that I can
see you by Xmas at least. Bye Bye Love to All, Kick.” Clifford married October 12, 1939 at
Greenup KY, Joan McClain born August 1, 1923 Champaign Co OH. In 1955, Clifford operated a sand
pit on his farm near Russells Point in Logans County OH and in the process of quarry operations,
uncovered 80-90 skeletons of Indians. The site was visited by archaeologists from the Ohio Historical
Society and the Indiana Historical Society and a group of students from Ohio State University. The
following was prepared by Clifford’s children [they all put their heads together, but Nancy wrote it] and
was read at his funeral by Nancy: “Special Memories of Dad, August 13, 1991: We have many
memories of Dad. We went through hard times and good times, but it’s the good times we choose to
remember and share. He had a lot of different names, Ike, Ikey, Kick, Cliff, Uncle Ike, Dad, Grandpa,
PaPa, PaPa Ike - most people called him Ike. We called him Dad. Life was difficult for him. He was
hard to know - to really know. He was an artisan - a talented finish carpenter. He expressed himself in
his work. Many homes in Logan and Champaign counties are more beautiful because of his creative
ability with wood. When he was no longer able to work he continued to create items of wood for his
family. We will always have the beautiful nativity mangers, the shelves, the banks, the picture frames,
the doll cradle, the stools. He was disappointed when his hands grew too numb to continue his work.
His favorite times were family gatherings. We will always remember that no one could fix the
Christmas ham or even slice it, but Dad; that he had the final say on the Christmas tree and had to put
the lights on, and it amazed us that a man who couldn’t cook could make such jummy peanut brittle at
Christmas. He enjoyed nature and taught us about clouds and bugs, turtles and trees, and gardening.
Glads were his favorite flower. He was a strong swimmer and we remember the swim rides on his back
way out to the stump, to what we thought was the middle of Indian Lake. We remember watching him
chop a hole in the pond ice before we could venture out on it and then build a fire to keep us warm. He

came closest to being himself when he was with his grandchildren and entertained them with his tall
tales about two snakes that swallowed each other and how he used to tie cats together by their tails and
hang them over the clothes line. He had a sense of humor and a quick wit and was merciless in using it
on us. He didn’t like to lose. Anyone who ever played a game of euchre, pinochle or canasta with him
knows he didn’t like to lose. In fact, he would keep a game going, trying every possible way to win
and usually did win against the odds. Even when he lost, he made you think he had won. True to
character, he didn’t like losing this summer’s battle with health. He fought hard and with Mom’s help
kept going, trying every possible way to win as he had done so often before. He did win, because this
time winning meant coming home to Mom and us, his chair, and the breeze on the front porch”. Born
to Clifford and Joan were:</div>
