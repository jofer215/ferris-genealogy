            <div class="person-text">(5.1.4.4.2.3) JONTHAN TRUMBULL JESSUP (twin) (Photo) born February 2, 1811 Greenwich and
died September 12, 1857 at sea off Cape Hatteras NC during the sinking of the S.S. Central
America (see the Net) on the return trip with his family from California; buried Lafayette IN. In 1825,
at the age of 14, while his twin brother was in NY learning the shipwright’s trade, Jonathan left
Greenwich and was not heard from for nearly 3 years. Upon his return, he settled briefly in New Haven
where his first cousin, Rufus Allen Lockwood, was a pre-divinity student. Shortly after his arrival, he is
believed to have enlisted in the Navy, eventually deserted, and returned to Greenwich. In the fall of
1829, he disappeared again and was not heard from for 8-9 years. By that time, he had acquired
considerable fame as a member of the bar in Lafayette IN under the name Rufus Allen Lockwood; his
name change probably occurred shortly after jumping ship and was said to be with the consent of the
father of the real Rufus Allen Lockwood; married August 28, 1832 in Tippecanoe Co IN, Harriet Hill
born June 5, 1812 Little York, Upper Canada and died November 18, 1897 Terre Haute IN; and born to
them were:</div>
