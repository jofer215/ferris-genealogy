(This is at the end of the document. An asterisk precedes the first word, although there is no corresponding asterisk within
the document, so it is not clear where this is supposed to go.)
* While on our way, by an accident apprently one of our men fell overboard, but instead of sinking, surfaced to float,
keeping his head above water until our boat passed around a corner. There is was (?) that he made headway toward shore,
and about this time 4 or 5 men fell overboard making about the same exhibition as no one swimming hard for them to sink,
which (?) excited the suspicion of the officers, and orders were given at once to slacken the speed, lower a row boat, man it,
&amp; capture or rescue the unfortunates. A hundred day officer was detailed to take charge, while here were plenty of ment to
assist. 5 or 6 more men anxious like the rest to gain laurels that their name might go down in history, either for bravery or
something else took their paddles &amp; (?) and worked with a delirium of effort to overtake the unfortunates but a little to late
as they had swum ashore and made tracks which led to their escape &amp; on reaching the land they all jumped ashore. Officer
in toward midstream with instructions to paddle his own canoe as he saw fit &amp; with shockingly apparent pleasure joined the
ranks of those that had made land a few min. begfore, which proved a well
concocted plan brought about. Doz. to desert. While laying here, many became harried, discouraged, faint-hearted &amp; (?).
Others were captured &amp; were shot every Friday, was the day always set aside for the week.
