Charles Phelps MARSH, late of Woodstock [Windsor County, Vermont], was born 07 January 1816 in Wethersfield
[Weathersfield, Windsor County, Vermont], son of John and Amstis [Anstis?] MARSH. He came of distinguished ancestry,
the first progenitor of the family being John MARSH, who organized a colony in Connecticut in 1635. The subject of this
sketch graduated from the University of Vermont in 1839, commenced the study of law in the office of Chandler &amp; Billings
of Woodstock, and was admitted to the bar in 1843 at the Mary term of the Windsor County court. A year later Mr. MARSH
formed a partnership with Peter T. WASHBURN, Esq., which continued for a quarter of a century. During these years of

active professional life he held several high positions of honor and trust, and for four years was state&#x27;s attorney for Windsor
County; in 1870 a member of the Constitutional Committee; in 1886 and 1888 represented Woodstock in the House of
Representatives; was for many years one of the assistant judges of Windsor County court, and the bar of his own county and
lawyers from other counties having cases at Woodstock were
content with his judgment and rulings as with those of a regular presiding judge from the supreme bench. A stranger would
have hardly selected him as one to lead in an &quot;end of the century&quot; body of legislators, yet in the House of 240 members,
made up largely of farmers, this faultlessly dressed lawyer of courtly but not new-fashioned manner did lead, and the secret
was an open one; he was a clear-headed, candid gentleman, one fit to represent Woodstock. Politically an original Harrison
and Clay Whig, and became an adherent of the Republican party when it was formed in 1854. He was a member of the
Masonic fraternity and the society of Odd Fellows. In 1842, while a law student, he edited the &quot;Whig Advocate,&quot; a
campaign paper, and with such care and ability that it attained a great circulation and won him deserved praise. Was always
a strong friend of education, an earnest advocate of morality and whatever tended to the promotion of the public good. His
talents both in business and in a judicial way were particularly administrative, and he ever evinced a mastery of the situation
whatever might be the emergency. His life was such in all his relations with his fellowmen that it is not to be wondered at
that his [Charles Phelps MARR&#x27;s] death, which occurred 13 January 1893, was so generally mourned in Vermont. On 05
[02?] July 1844 he [Charles Phelps MARR] was married to Mary Elizabeth, daughter of Rev. Worthington WRIGHT. Four
sons were born to them, the oldest of whom alone survives: John W. MARSH, Esq., a lawyer now residing in Chicago
[Cook County, Illinois]. Mrs. MARSH died in 1854 and Judge [Charles Phelps] MARSH contracted a second alliance, in
1859, with [Miss?] Amelia BRAYTON, of Swanton [Franklin County, Vermont], who survives him.</div>
