            <div class="person-text">(5.1.2.9.3.2.4) SUSAN PURDY (c1842-) married 1870 Eugene Beauharnais Travis [son of Dr. Albert
Gallatin Travis and Sarah Jane (Satterlee) born September 22, 1844 Kent NY and died November 13,
1908; both buried Hillside Cemetery, Peekskill NY. Obituary, Highland Democrat, Peekskill, NY, Nov.
14, 1908: Eugene B. Travis, Peekskill&#x27;s well known lawyer, dropped dead on the porch of the Holman
house at Van Cortlandtville yesterday (Friday) morning. He left his house about 9 o&#x27;clock and walked
to the corner of Hillside Avenue to take the trolley for Peekskill, according to his daily custom. He was
apparently in his usual health. Waren W. Dyckman, the surveyor, was working in that neighborhood. A
farmer passing in a wagon notified him that a man had just fallen down on Holman&#x27;s porch. Dyckman
went to the spot and found Mr. Travis, who had fallen forward on his face. A copy of his horse&#x27;s
pedigree and a book lay on the porch. It is supposed he had to wait for a car and had stepped on the
porch to avoid the severe wind that was blowing. Mr. Dyckman notified Coroner Silleck at once. The
coroner went to the scene and had the body removed to Croft&#x27;s undertaking establishment. Dr. P. H.
Mason made an examination and pronounced the cause of death as apoplexy. No arrangements for the
funeral have yet been made. Eugene Beauharnais Travis born in Kent, Putnam County NY September
22, 1844. His father was Dr. Albert Gallatin Travis, a well and favorably known physician in that
locality in those days. His mother was Sarah Jane, the youngest daughter of Judge Satterlee, of Putnam
County. There were two others brothers-Francis Marian, who went to New London, Va., thirty years

ago, and who is still there, and Millard Fillmore Travis, who settled in Florida about twenty-five years
ago and is yet a resident of that State. Mr. Travis received his early education at the Red Mills Academy
and studying long and faithfully at home soon found himself well prepared to cope with the world,
educationally. He began teaching in Putnam County and continued in that honorable profession for
seven years. Meantime the law appealed to him and he began the study of Blackstone under such noted
jurists as J.G. Miller, of Carmel; David Wiley Travis, of Peekskill, and Edward Wells, of Peekskill. He
was admitted to the bar in Brooklyn, Dec. 15, 1870. Since that time he had practiced law in Peekskill
and was in point of service as well as age one of Peekskill&#x27;s oldest attorneys. For many years he had his
office at the corner of Main and Division streets, but more recently in the Eagle Hotel building, Main
Street. Mr. Travis, while he was an all around lawyer, had been exceptionally successful in the trial of
jury cases, and when he failed to secure a verdict it was the exception rather than the rule. His
appearance before the jury, especially in the summing up, was always the signal for the most careful
attention, because it was known that something good would be heard. Mr. Travis was quite a fraternity
man. He was a member of Phillipstown Lodge, No. 236 F. &amp; A.M. of Cold Spring, in which he was
raised June 4, 1896. He was a very enthusiastic Mason. He joined Harmony Lodge No. 138 K. of P.,
fifteen years ago and has always been active in lodge work, though never passing through the chairs.
He had been a member of the Cortlandt Lodge No. 6, I.O.O.F., for thirty-nine years. His favorite
fraternity was the Ancient Order of United Workmen. He organized Dunderberg Lodge, No. 156,
A.O.U.W., in 1878. He was its first Past Master and took an active interest in it from the start. He was
its first representative to the Grand Lodge and there became at once equally influential. The first year
he was elected to the Grand Overseer&#x27;s chair, three stations from the highest. In due time he was Grand
Master of the Ancient Order of United Workmen of the State of New York. Three times he was one of
the three New York Grand Lodge representatives to the Supreme Grand Lodge, meeting at Toronto,
can.; Detroit, Mich., and Nashville, Tenn., consecutively. Unlike many fraternity men, who having
achieved the honors, drop down and out, he kept up his interest in the ranks as he did in the line.
Rather, his zeal for the Workmen increased and he was as busy in the local lodge and in the annual
sessions of the Grand Lodge of late years as he was when he held high office. He was also a member of
the Lincoln Society and of its executive committee; also an honorary member of the Survivors
Association of the Harris Light Cavalry (Second New York), and when they dedicated and unveilied a
monument on the field of Gettysburg, Sept. 19, 1892, it was Eugene B. Travis who was selected to
deliver the oration. His address at that time was well worthy the commendation it received. Mr. Travis
was quite a fireman in his earlier years. He joined Cortlandt Hook &amp; Ladder Co. No. 1, May 2, 1878,
but resigned the same year. He became a member of Cul. Engine Co. No. 1, Dec. 6, 1878. He was a
member of Peekskill Lodge, No.744, B.P.O. Elks, and at its memoral service, Dec. 1903, he delivered
the memorial address in the Colonial Theatre. He was a member of the Westchester County Bar
Association and was very active in its work. Every year he was on some important committee; he
seldom missed one of its annual dinners and was a frequent speaker there. He was very active in
educational work. He was for many years a trustee in the Van Cortlandtville School and not only
attended the commencements, but there was hardly a week that went by but he was at the school
looking after its interests, encouraging its teacher and its scholars. He gave prizes and awarded honors,
and the Van Cortlandtville School lost a dear friend in the death of Eugene B. Travis. Politically,
Eugene B. Travis was as well known as he was fraternally and professionally. Born and bred a

Democrat, he was carried into the Republican Party like many others during the Civil War. In 1876 he
was a candidate of that party against Owen T. Coffin for the office of Surrogate of Westchester County,
but with the party was defeated, Mr. Coffin&#x27;s majority being 2, 865. In the town election on March 27,
1877, he ran on his party ticket for Commissioner of Highways against William Hickey and was
elected by the handsome majority of 245, Hickey receiving 837 votes and Travis 1, 082 in the town of
Cortlandt. In 1885 he ran for Commissioner of Highways against Adolph Tompkins and was defeated
by 267, receiving 1,135 to 1,314 for Mr. Tompkins. The following year he was the Democratic nominee
for Member of Assembly in this Third Assembly District. He made a good run and received 3, 083
votes. In 1896 he received in Liberty Hall the unanimous nomination for Member of Congress on the
regular Democratic ticket. He made a gallant fight, but was handicapped by the candidacy of Crawford,
who ran on the Gold Democratic ticket, and by McKinley&#x27;s marvelous run. Travis received 12,005
votes and William M. Ward 17,988, a majority of 5,983. He served very creditably a term as
Corporation Counsel several years ago, when the Board of Village Trustees was Democratic. In the fall
of 1905 he was a candidate for Supervisor of the town of Cortlandt against S. Fletcher Allen, who
defeated him by 907. The vote was, Allen 2,208, Travis 1,301. He has also taken an active interest in
the party. He had attended scores of conventions, village, town, county, assembly, district, senatorial,
congressional, judicial and state. He had been on the stump, where he was a most effective and
convincing political orator. In 1884 he stumped the western part of the State under the auspices of the
State Committee. He was a good personal canvasser and never left a stone unturned to be elected in an
honorable manner to any office to which he was nominated. During the recent campaign he was an
ardent Bryan and Chanler enthusiast and stumped Putnam County for the ticket. Mr. Travis was very
fond of legitimate sports. He played a good game of chess and was the president of the Peekskill Chess
Club when it was in its greatest prosperity. He was a clever billiard player. When he had reached the
age where he could not circuit the bases of the diamond very well, there was no greater enthusiast in
baseball than he. Peekskill fans all knew that it was for him the once famous Travis Baseball Nine was
named, and in those days Mr. Travis would rather watch his beloved club play the game of all games
than eat a meal. e was also an admirer of horses, and up at his Gallows Hill place he had been breeding
high class road horses. He had owned Tyrant, a son of Dictator; Clay, a son of Electioneer; St. Arnold,
the son of Cuyler, and so on. For many years he resided on Smith street, but for the past twenty years
he lived on a spacious and beautiful farm up on the historical Gallows Hill, where hundreds of
veterans, firemen, Sunday school children and others had enjoyed his hospitality in clambakes,
reunions, picnics, etc. Mr. Travis married in 1870, Susan the daughter of Nicholas Purdy. They had two
children, both living-Thurlow and Leila, the latter the wife of Welford Croft, both of Peekskill. Mr.
Travis personality was very striking. He stood tall, broad shouldered and with a distinguished military
air. His white locks and white mustache and his equipoise at all times distinguished him among others,
either on the street or on the stage or in the public hall. He was a fine looking man, and wherever he
went was the cynosure of all eyes. He was a charming conversationalist, a good storyteller, a strong
public speaker. He was a delightful companion and had made many friends not only in this section, but
all over the State. Born to them were:</div>
