            <div class="person-text">(5.1.3.4.10.4.1.1) LETTIE LENORE FERRIS born 1870 and drowned in the Sioux River, about 2
blocks west of her parents’ home at Beloit IA in October, 1881; buried Beloit IA. Obituary: ‘Last
Tuesday one of those sad accidents, which shock and startle a community occurred at Beloit. A little
daughter of Mr. Ferris, the proprietor of the Beloit Hotel, was standing on the footbridge watching the
workmen engaged in rebuilding the Beloit Bridge. She was seized by a sudden dizziness and fell into
the river. She floated down the stream some little distance to the ferryboat and passed under that,
coming to the surface again and then sank to rise no more. The accident was witnessed by a number of
men, none of whom could swim. By many, it is thought the ferryman who was on the boat at the time,
had he possessed sufficient presence of mind, could have rescued the child, but being unable to swim
he feared to make the necessary effort. George Sherman, who was attracted by the crowd, came
running to the river. Without a moment&#x27;s hesitation he plunged in and swam after the drowning child.
He was a few minutes too late as she sank for the last time before he reached her. Hooks were procured
and Messrs. King and Angell succeeded in a very short time in recovering the body but all efforts to
restore its life were unavailing. In the sad and untimely death of their little darling, the parents have the
tenderest sympathy of this entire community. The funeral which took place at the Beloit church on
Wednesday was very largely attended by sympathizing friends.’</div>
