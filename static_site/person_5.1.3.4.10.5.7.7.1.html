(5.1.3.4.10.5.7.7.2) JAMES BLAIR PETERS (Photographs) (1935-) married 1st Mary Elizabeth
Guerin; 2d Susan Helen Kavulich. Jim is the provider of this updated information and the wonderful
photographs – thanks Jim! Jim has also provided the below:
The following are biographical sketches of my grandparents Asa Warren Ferris and his wife Clara
Elmira Riblet. This first one is transcribed from a document written by Joyce Ferris Swan (a freelance
writer) when she interviewed our aunt Caroline (Carrie) Susie (not Susan) Ferris Carnes. In
explanation, Joyce and I are first cousins, her father being Arthur Benjamin Ferris and me (James)
being the son of Arthur’s youngest sister Ruth Marion Ferris Peters. Carrie, being an aunt to both
Joyce and myself and the oldest daughter of Asa and Clara. January 8, 1974, Joyce Ferris Swan,
Columnist-Free Lance Writer, R.D. 2 Westfield, New York 14787.
“I learned from my aunt Caroline (Carrie, we always called her), in the fall of 1972 when I
visited her in a nursing home just outside of North East, Pennsylvania when she was 87 (?) that:
My father, Arthur Benjamin Ferris, born in Clay Center Kansas. That she (Carrie) born eleven
months afterwards, also in Clay Center. That she was three years old when they (her mother, Clara
Riblet Ferris and father, Asa Ferris, and my father Arthur), returned to Erie County, PA. She said that
uncle Ben Riblet, who owned a farm in Harborcreek, PA was not happy with the way it was being run
and he wanted his niece Clara and her husband Asa to come home and run it. Uncle Ben Riblet also
owned and ran a general store in Harborcreek, located near the railroad tracks by the underpass.
My grandmother, Clara Riblet Ferris, had told me (Joyce), when I was a little girl, and living on
that same farm, which was then being purchased from his father (Asa) by my father (Arthur), that she
(Clara) had gone to Kansas in a covered wagon, with her mother (Caroline Phoebe Blair) and father
(Thomas Charles Riblet)
In 1972, Aunt Carrie said that her mother (Clara) was 14 when they went to Kansas. They
homesteaded, and took up a claim in Trego County, Kansas. A family history written by Rev. Clarence
Riblet, Clara’s brother, verifies this. They proved up their claim in Trego County and then moved to
Clay Center, Kansas where they had other relatives. Aunt Carrie said that things were very hard for
them on the homestead, as they lived in a sod house on the prairie and were sent things from the
Harborcreek Store by Uncle Ben. As a young woman, Clara was a schoolteacher in Kansas and
someone in the family told me (Carrie) that when she was riding horseback to or from her school that
Asa Ferris saw her and said that was the girl he was going to marry, and he did.”
I (James) do not know the author of this next document. The hand writing looks like my mothers (Ruth
Marion Ferris Peters) but I am not sure.
“Asa Warren Ferris born August 19, 1860 near Greensburg, Indiana. As a young man, probably
about 20, he worked in a sawmill. When it blew up, and he was nearly killed by a piece of flying metal
missing his head by inches, he and his brother (Elmer? or James?) traveled to Kansas where he (Asa)
worked as a cook on a sheep ranch for a man named Gleason.
He saw a girl driving a spotted pony and said to himself “there’s the girl for me”
The girl was Clara Elmira Riblet who was teaching school at the time. They were married January 1,
1884.

After their first three children were born, they moved to Harborcreek, PA. They worked and
finally bought a farm previously owned by Benjamin Riblet, brother of Clara’s father. They had four
more children.”</div>
