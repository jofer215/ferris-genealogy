            <div class="person-text">(3.10.1.2.1.9.4) URANIA M. PECK born October 15, 1810 Solon, Cortland, NY and died October 8,
1866 Cortlandville NY; married April 30, 1833 in Cortland NY by her father, as his 2d wife, Thomas
Darby [son of Joseph &amp; Anna (Grow)] born December 6, 1802 Homer, Cortland, NY and died
February 22, 1883 Cortland NY. The Cortland Standard, March 15, 1883: Obituary, Thomas Darby,
age 81, in Cortland Feb. 22, 1883 - &quot;He born in this town, and when seventeen years of age, was
baptized together with a large number of young people by Elder Alfred Bennett, then pastor of the
Homer Baptist Church, located near the present fair grounds. He was one of the constituent members of
the Homer Cortland &amp; McGrawville Juvenile society, nearly sixty years ago, and which is still
successful in operation today. In 1829 he married Miss Abigail Sumner and settled in the town of
Dryden (until 1867), uniting with the McLean Baptist Church of which he was for many years an
honored Deacon. Having lost his wife by death, in 1833, he married Miss Urana M. Peck, and after her
decease in 1867, he married Miss Harriet &quot;Ida&quot; Brown in 1868, by whom he was tenderly cared for
during his declining years. Sixteen years since he moved to this village (Cortlandville), of which he has
been a quiet respected citizen, and an esteemed member of the Baptist church. The last few years of his
life were years of infirmity and much suffering, and his death was not the unwelcome close of a long
and exemplary life. His funeral was attended February 24, services by Rev G. W. Putnam, his Pastor,
assisted by Rev G. F. Stark, a long-time honored friend.” &gt;From the Will of Thomas Darby - Codicil obtained from the Cortland Co Courthouse. “Whereas I Thomas Darby of the town of Cortlandville,

Cortland County and State of New York have made my will in writing bearing date on the 31st day of
July 1873 in and by which I have given to my son Wayland D. Darby a fourth part of my estate with
certain exceptions &amp; in which I gave to said Wayland one eighth of my household furniture &amp; in which
will I appointed Edwin P. Slafter &amp; Emmett A. Fish executors of said Will. Now therefore I do by this
new writing which I hereby declare to be a Codicil to my said last will and testament, and to be taken
as a part thereof order &amp; declare that my will is that the half of my household furniture not given to my
wife I now give &amp; bequeath to my daughter Cordelia Nye &amp; to my Son Nathan to be divided equally
between them Share and share alike. I give bequeath and devise to my Son Nathan P. Darby &amp; Thomas
Darby Jr. each one equal undivided one third of the remainder of my estate which in said will was
given to my son Wayland D. Darby now deceased &amp; the remaining one third so given to said Wayland I
now give &amp; devise to Edwin P. Slafter in trust for my daughter Cordelia Nye, and at her decease to be
paid to her children in the same manner &amp; under the same restrictions in all respects as are prescribed
in said will as to the bequest to said Slafter in trust for Cordelia &amp; her children. Lastly I hereby
nominate &amp; appoint my son Nathan P. Darby &amp; my said wife Harriet Darby to be executor and
executive of this Codicil to my last will &amp; testament and to be executors of my said will in lieu and
instead of the executors named in My said last will and testament. And lastly it is my desire that this
codicil be annexed to and made a part of my last will and testament in aforesaid and to all intents &amp;
purposes. In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and seal this 3rd day of January, 1877”
