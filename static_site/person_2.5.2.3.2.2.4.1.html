and upon arriving at the age of 21y he had so successfully the financial affairs of the store that he was
able not only to buy the stock, but to build a larger and better building. His business soon enabled him
to become acquainted with prominent businessmen of NYC in that early day and in the year 1834, a
wealthy corporation was organized for the purpose of purchasing land in the West, and in looking
around for shrewd and careful business man to act as agent, he was selected to visit Illinois and
Michigan to buy lands for the company. In 1834, he disposed of his business and went West, bringing
with him a considerable amount of money. After spending 2y in Illinois, on the 2d of June 1836, he
arrived at the Knaggs trading post on the Shiawassee River. In July 1836 he became a settler in the
northeastern part of the town of Antrim. At that time there were only 11 other settlers in the town. At
first he did not expect to become a farmer and did not live all of the time in the vicinity, but spent
considerable time in Detroit and Kalamazoo. He also about that time visited Illinois and Fort Mackinaw
