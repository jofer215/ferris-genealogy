and died January 2, 2002; married June 24, 1972 Martha Singleton Needham; Obit Chicago Tribune,
January 4, 2002: Robert C. Ferris, 74, a postwar entrepreneur whose company made television
components and parts for automobiles and electronic games for more than 40 years, died of respiratory
failure Wednesday, January 2, in Bethesda Hospital in Florida. A jovial man with an open smile, he was
perfectly suited to a business that stressed personal contact and a good-natured view of the components
in which it dealt – often inventions that Mr. Ferris designed himself. He was a very practical person and
had a great sense of how things fit together and worked, said his stepson John Needham. The
components were simple but ubiquitous inventions, Needham said, such as the lights that illuminated
dials on TV sets, car trunk lights and the miniature red lights in smoke alarms. His parts subsequently
were incorporated into entire product lines, including Delco radios, General Motors cars and light
socket assemblies for Dirt Devil vacuum cleaners. In the 1990s, Mr. Ferris donated land he bought in
rural Putnam County to a waterfowl habitat restoration project. He also supported other wildlife
restoration efforts along the Illinois River. When it came to wildlife, he was first of all enchanted by it,
said Donald Hey, senior VP of the Wetlands Initiative, an Illinois conservation group. On his own
property, he created prairies, created a lake system. I often would visit him on the farm and see him
sitting by the lake, watching the dragonflies and geese. He just had a lifelong dedication to preservation
of those ecosystems. Mr. Ferris born in Princeton IL, and attended the U. of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign. He left and served as a Navy corpsman at the Great Lakes Naval Training Center in the
early 1950s. He later started his own company in Chicago – Christiana Industries – to make electrical
parts for the television and automobile industries. In 1972 he married the former Martha Singleton,
publicity director for Bonwit Teller department stores in Chicago. Mr. Ferris operated Christiana
Industries for four decades, retiring in 1994 after selling it to Lake Forest-based Waud Capital Partners,
LLC. (Surprise, Surprise – Christiana Industries closed its operations in Vernon Hills IL 2007 and

moved to Mexico!) It gave him a lot of creative opportunities, and he met a lot of wonderful people,
said his wife. He just had a very fertile brain. He was always coming up with different ways to use his
own products. That attribute was typified in the 1970s when Mr. Ferris, an avid curler and golfer,
noticed the ragtag collection of ropes and signs used at golf courses to direct golf cart drivers. Mr.
Ferris started a side business called Coursesigns that manufactured signs that subsequently appeared at
thousands of golf courses. He was a former president of the Exmoor Country Club in Highland Park, a
governor of Shoreacres Club and a director of the Evans Scholars Foundation, which provides college
scholarships to golf caddies. Besides his wife and stepson, survivors include a stepdaughter, Kathryn
Needham Hodges; four granddaughters and three nephews. A memorial service will be held at 2 p.m.
Tuesday in Kenilworth Union Church, 211, Kenilworth Ave, Kenilworth (Cook, IL); both buried

From The Beta Upsilon Booster: Tribute to Bob Ferris ‘49
Some brothers can still see Bob Ferris ’49, a respected, successful businessman in jacket and tie, stooping to clean up the
yard at the Delta Tau Delta chapter house. The stories of his devotion are the stuff of Delt legend. At a time when few
alumni even wanted to be associated with the chapter, in the wake of some bad national publicity, Bob Ferris stuck with the
undergraduates. Some say, Bob Ferris and John Gleeson brought the chapter back from the edge of doom. On Wednesday,
January 2, 2002, Robert C. Ferris, entrepreneurial business leader and environmental preservationist, passed away from a
respiratory illness at the age of 74 in Bethesda Hospital in Florida.
Among Delt brothers, Bob’s greatest contribution to preservation may well be his role in preserving our
“habitat” at the University of Illinois. Every chapter has within its alumni ranks individuals which stand out in the history of
the chapter, said Ken File, executive vice president of the Delta Tau Delta Educational Foundation. For Beta-Upsilon there’s
no man who could be of greater importance to the chapter than Bob Ferris. Through the darkest times of the chapter he
stood by this group and helped point them in the direction which has led to their rise to one of the best chapters at the
University of Illinois. I don’t think they would have made it without him and John Gleeson.
Brothers who lived through that dark time remember Bob well. I don’t know what drove him, said David
Robertson, ’82. He was a great friend in a difficult time. We reorganized the fraternity; he was one of the big supporters.
The TV got stolen and he showed up with a new TV, which made a huge difference and was a great morale booster. In the
early years, he visited quite a lot and was a great source of help and support and inspiration.
Chapter Advisor Matt Wilson ’89 said, I view Bob as the guy who made it his personal mission to see that Delt
succeeded and, even as an undergrad that was inspiring to me to see this guy who cared so deeply about the place. That had
a major impact on the way I felt about the fraternity. When you heard he was coming to campus, it was like your Dad was
coming to campus. You wanted everything to be right for him.
The lasting legacy is that he made a major gift two years ago to the project that moved our fraternity into its new
house. It was a gift of $150,000, Brother Wilson said. And it illustrated to us how serious Bob was about doing this right.
This was his crowning achievement. He passed away happy with where his fraternity stood. We are sad about his passing
but feel he must have been happy with what he had done to provide for future Delts. Ken File agreed, the most recent
success of their capital fund drive would never have been possible without Bob’s visionary leadership. He’ll be missed not
only by Illinois Delts but by Delts all over the country.
Carl Vogel knew Brother Ferris when he was an undergraduate, and saw that same servant-leader attitude 50
years ago. He died whatever the heck he could do. He was always at the end of the parade – just a hell of a loyal guy, Vogel
said. You wish you had 50 fraternity brothers like him – just being 110 percent Delt from his pledge days forward, and very
loyal. He was a natural talent, Brother Vogel added. If he saw a need, he would just jump in and do it. He enjoyed that more
than school. The fraternity brothers were very important to him. He didn’t understand anybody being a lukewarm member.
Bob did everything in the world around the fraternity. Our cook quit around finals week- probably her rebellion against us –
and Bob took over the cooking for 50-60 people. He didn’t ask anybody. He just did it. He was a Delt through and through –
from when he pledged until he left.

He didn’t graduate. He’d go to school for six or eight weeks and get bored, Vogel said. One year he hitchhiked
to Seattle. I don’t know what he did up there. And then he hitchhiked down to Rancho Santa Fe, California. When the hell
have you been, and he said, I just left Ranch Santa Fe a few days ago, but the trucks were a little slow getting me back here.
His nickname was “Apples”, Brother Vogel said. His mother would send crates of apples to the house. He kept
them in the closet, but it wasn’t locked, and a case of apples didn’t last very long. He never knew exactly who the
beneficiaries were. So he became “Apples” Ferris.
One fall he came back to school, and he’s got a late ‘30s model Ford, Vogel recalled. During the summer he had
rolled it. He explained that he was going like a bat out of hell down a country road and couldn’t stop it, and so he went into
a ditch and he rolled it. He didn’t want to waste the car so he got someone with an acetylene torch to cut the roof off, and he
had a convertible. He was so proud of his new convertible. It if rained, he said, It’s going to get wet inside, but it will dry
out.
Bob Ferris was born in Princeton, Illinois. He served as a Navy corpsman at the Great Lakes Naval Training
Center in the early 1950s. He is survived by his wife, Martha Ferris, a stepson, stepdaughter, four granddaughters, and three
nephews.</div>
