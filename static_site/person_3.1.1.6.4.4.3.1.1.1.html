the war, he became an associate and later a partner with Paxton and Seasongood law firm. After 32
years, he organized a new law firm with Booth Shepard in 1974. “In his quiet way, Bob Hilton, with his
generous and engaging spirit, was the quintessential good citizen of Cincinnati,” said friend and fellow
lawyer Bruce Petrie of Hyde Park. “He was active and effective in many groups and organizations
working to advance the community, and he devoted endless hours and attention to that cause”. The
nephew of Agnes Hilton, one of the founders of the Charter Committee of Greater Cincinnati, Mr
Hilton served in a number of positions with the Charter party, including campaign co-chairman, review
committee chairman and candidate for City Council in 1955. He served on several boards, including
