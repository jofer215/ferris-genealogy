            <div class="person-text">(5.1.3.8.6.4) NATHANIEL BETTS FERRIS (Photographs) born October 31, 1839 Greenwich on the
paternal farm, where he passed his early life; education was acquired in the local public schools and
Greenwich Academy, and he lived at home until 1870, when he relocated to a place in Prospect Street,
just north of Enos E. Lockwood&#x27;s, whereon he made his home for about seven years, during which time
he gave his attention to private affairs, and acted as administrator of various estates. Meanwhile the
