THE ADVENTURES OF A FORTY-NINER An Historic Description of California, with Events and Ideas
of San Francisco and Its People in Those Early Days By DANIEL KNOWER 1894
That winter a convention was called to organize a State government and apply for admission to the Union. The Southern
element there wanted to make it a slave State. The Northerners, including both Whigs and Democrats, wanted it free. They
did not want to be brought in competition with slave labor in the mines, and have their occupation degraded in that way.
Their pride, as well as interest, was at stake, and there was great feeling on the subject. Meetings were called all through the
mines and addresses made and candidates nominated. The average of intelligence there was away above any other part of
the country. For they were men of enterprise, or they would not have been there in that early day. At Mormon Island, one of
the miners got up and made a speech. He so impressed them with his ability that they unanimously nominated him as their
candidate to the Constitutional Convention. He was an old acquaintance of mine. In 1847 or 1848 he was a Democratic
member of the Legislature of the State of New York, from Washington county, and was chosen by that body to deliver the
oration on Washington&#x27;s birthday. His name was George Washington Sherwood. He was elected to the Constitutional
Convention of California, and wrote its first Constitution, copied after that of his native State, New York.
