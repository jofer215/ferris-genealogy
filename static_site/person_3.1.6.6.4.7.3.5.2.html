            <div class="person-text">(3.1.6.6.4.7.3.5.2) MABEL CLAIR ANDERSON born January 27, 1894 Lusk, Pope, IL; was raised as
an only child, since her brother, Elmer, had died in infancy. It was a lonely life, but she was happy,
amusing herself outdoors and playing with another only child named Christa Kluge, who lived across
the big field from her. Pleasant Valley School was down in the valley about a mile from Mabel&#x27;s house
and she walked down the hill over huge rocks and through dense trees, which they called the bluff. The
school was one room with double seats, heated by a large stove in winter, with grades one through
eight. An older Bonnel neighbor girl took a ‘fancy’ to Mabel and begged permission from the teacher
to bring Mabel to school when she was only four years old. No one could keep her away from school
after that and she always cried on the last day. Mabel was about 12 years old when her parents moved
to Stonefort IL; she went through high school in Stonefort and graduated, 1910, as valedictorian in her
class of seven. Mabel taught first and second grades in Big Muddy IL school for three years before she
married March 22, 1914 at Stonefort IL, Floyd H. Nolen born November 29, 1890; lived on the Nolen
farm until 1932 when they moved to Terra Haute IN; and born to them were:
