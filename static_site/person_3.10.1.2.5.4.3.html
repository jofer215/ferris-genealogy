History of Gratiot Co (1913), p. 277:
From an article on Hugh Daily:
One time there were four of us with teams going to St. Johns--Parks Allen, Jerry Shaver, Herman Shaver and myself. We
stopped over at Coleman&#x27;s, four miles this side of St. Johns. The next morning Herman and I ran four miles to see the cars,
leaving our ox-teams in charge of the others. We had never seen a railroad. We saw the railroad that morning, but the cars
had gone before we got there; but it was quite a treat to see even the railroad. Afterward I worked on the railroad that came
into St. Louis.
History of Gratiot County (1913) p. 282:
Jerry Shaver, section 17 of Emerson Township, was born in Delaware County, N.Y., November 19, 1822. He is a son of
Jacob and Sally (Kinch) Shaver of Delaware County, N.Y., and grand son of John and Elizabeth (Parks) Sahver, the former

Emerson, and remained there until his death, July 21, 1873, at the age of 77 years. His wife, Sally Shaver, lived but two
months after his death, passing away in her 77th year. Jerry Shaver was the tenth in a family of eleven children born to
Jacob and Sally Shaver. Now in his 91st year, he is remarkably well preserved, considering his advanced age, gettinga bout
quite lively and without the aid of a cane. His wife, now deceased, whose maiden name was Ursula Sawtell, was one of
twelve children born ot Richard and Cordelia (Reid) Sawtell. She was born in Chenango County, N.Y, September 27, 1826,
and died at her home in Emerson, August 25, 1909, aged nearly 83 years. Her father who was a physician, died in the state
of New York in 1842. Her mother came to Michigan after the death of her husband, and died at the home of her daughter,
Ursula, in 1865. Jerry Shaver and Ursula Sawtell were married May 30, 1846, in Canisteo, Steuben County, N.Y. Four
children were born to them. William died in infancy. Herman D., born March 2, 1848; Mary A. born July 21, 1850, died
January 10, 1870; J. Frank born June 2, 1864. Herman D. Shaver and family lived in Michigan until 1906 when they moved
to California. They now own a farm and reside in the Sacramento Valley. Frank Shaver, born in Emerson Township, June 2,
1864, has lived until the present time on the same farm on which he was born. He was united in marriage in 1889 to Edna
Brown, daughter of Edgar A. and Mary (DePeel) Brown, of Emerson, Rev. C.A. Jacokes performing the ceremony. From
this union three children have been born--Irl, born May 4, 1892; Carl, born January 30, 1894; Marjorie, born December 4,
1896. Irl is now a resident of Princeton, California, where he went in 1909 for the benefit of his heal Jerry Shaver, the father,

1856 came to Gratiot and settled on wild land, section 17, Emerson Township, where he still resides with his son Frank. He
and his family were here all through the &quot;starvation times&quot; and with many others, suffered many of the hardships and
privations that fell to the lot of those early settlers; hardships difficult to exaggerate in the telling, and which none of them
ever desired to have duplicated. The aged pioneer has always enjoyed the confidence and good will of his townsmen.
Politically he has always been a Democrat. Officially he has served his township acceptably as supervisor. The oldest son,
Herman, was elected Justice of the peace in 1890, and was re-elected in 1894.Frank Shaver has served his township as
