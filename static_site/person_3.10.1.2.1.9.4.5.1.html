Sarah (Philippi)] born July 26, 1867 in Clarksville, Iowa, and died there November 08, 1942.Lucius
was exceptionally tall for a man in the late 1800&#x27;s - 6&#x27;1&quot; or 6&#x27;2&quot; tall. His son Clarence Darby always
said he could find his Dad in a crowd, just look for the man who was about a head taller than everyone
else. He was large framed, well built, and always carried himself very erect - had a notable posture. He
had a light complexion, gray eyes; auburn hair &amp; red beard, and was bald by the time he was 40 years
old. He had a deep booming voice &amp; hearty laugh, and loved to sing - the same could be said about his
son Clarence&#x27;s voice, laugh &amp; love of singing. Lucius could take music and whistle out a new tune
from it. He moved to Clarksville from New York with his parents when he was just 8 months old. He
had diabetes 7-8 years before his death, as did his son Clarence.
