            <div class="person-text">(3.1.2.3.1.1.6) DAVID PETER FERRIS born January 8, 1816 ‘near’ Cincinnati, Hamilton, OH and
died April 25, 1892 Manchester, Delaware, IA; buried there Oakland Cemetery (Photo); married
1st August 4, 1834 Hannah Ann Cook [dau of Elisah &amp; Wealtha Cook] born March 28, 1816 IN or NY
and died August 12, 1839 St. Joseph Co IN after childbirth of twins; and 2d April 12, 1840 in St.
Joseph Co IN, Lucy Vaughn born 1818 IN and died November 8, 1883; there are several dates for

David’s second marriage, but the one listed here comes from a record book he maintained and which is
in the possession of his great-granddaughter, Jean, below; David moved to Mishawaka IN 1836, then
prior to 1861 (1856?) to Manchester, Delaware, IA where they raised their family. From a newspaper
announcement: Mr. D. P. Ferris, of this township, died, Tuesday, after an illness of many months. He
was one of the early settlers here, having come in 1856, and was a man held in the highest esteem by
all who knew him. He leaves four sons and three daughters. From an article in Biographical Souvenir
of the Counties of Delaware and Buchanan, Iowa, 1890: David P. Ferris: In Hamilton County, Ohio,
near the corporate limits of the city of Cincinnati, on a farm, which then belonged to General William
Henry Harrison, David P. Ferris, the subject of this brief biographical notice, born on the eighth day of
January, 1816. His parents, Isaiah and Lucinda (Crouch) Ferris, who were natives of Chautauqua
county NY, moved to Ohio about 1815, and settled on the farm above mentioned, where they resided a
short time, during which time their son, David P., born. They subsequently moved to Dearborn county,
Indiana, where they lived for 21 years, moving thence to St. Joseph county, that state, and settling near
the town of Mishawaukee, where they spent the remainder of their lives. They belonged to the pioneer
class of American citizens, the father being a carpenter and farmer, and passing his life in the
industrious pursuit of these two callings. He served in the War of 1812, and afterwards moved into the
country and helped to rescue from the wilderness of nature, the soil, which he had helped to win from
the savages and enemies of this country. He and his wife were for many years members of the Baptist
church, and brought up their children in the path of honesty, sobriety and moral rectitude. They had
twelve children, two of whom died in infancy, the remainder reaching maturity; most of them marrying
and having families. These were Delinda, Parmelia, Zubie, David P., Betsie, Lucinda, Roxie, Melina,
Louis, and Isaiah. David P. Ferris was reared on a farm in Dearborn County, Indiana. He received a
limited common-school education, most of his boyhood and youth being spent in the labors of the farm,
his school days being restricted to a few months during winter. But he grew up a good, strong, healthy
boy, and if his mental equipment was not the best, he was taught habits of industry which went far
towards compensating for his other disadvantages. He married just before he attained his twentieth
year, and began life for himself. He settled on a farm in St. Joseph County, Indiana, where he
continued in agricultural pursuits for nearly twenty years, his first move being in 1856, when he came
to Iowa and settled where he now lives in Delaware Co. On coming to Delaware County, Mr. Ferris
bought eighty acres of land in section 15, Delaware Township, on which he located and on which he
has since resided. He had added to this, however, by other purchases, until he now owns 320 acres.
The improvements represent his own labor, as he took his land when it was all raw prairie. His first
dwelling was a small frame, 16x18, and his first stable was the cheap shiplap affair common in those
days. In 1876 he built his present residence, which is a handsome structure, having all conveniences
necessary for use and enjoyment. In 1875 he erected part of his present barn, adding to it in 1887, now
having a building sufficient to house his stock and farm products. He has nice groves of trees and
shrubbery, which are the result of his own industry and skill, he having set out every sprig now growing
on his place. While thus looking after his own interest, he has kept pace with the progress of affairs in
his township and has lent a helping hand to every worthy enterprise and purpose which have sought aid
at his hands. On August 12, 1834, Mr. Ferris married, his choice for a life companion falling on a
young lady whom he had known from childhood up, Miss Hannah A. Cook, of Dearborn county, Ind.,
she having been born in that county, and being a daughter of Elisha and Wealthy Cook, who were

among the early settlers of that locality. By this marriage Mr. Ferris had four children, all girls, as
follows - Nancy, Rosetta; and Wealthy and Lucinda, twins. August 12, 1839, Mrs. Ferris died, and
May 12, 1840, Mr. Ferris married again, taking as his second wife Miss Lucy Vaughn, of St. Joseph
county, Ind., she being a native, however, of Dearborn county, that state, born in 1818, and a daughter
of Jesse and Barbara Vaughn. Mr. Ferris had the misfortune to lose his second wife, November 8,
1883, she having been the mother of seven children, all but one of who survive her. These are Mary,
Rebecca E., Daniel, Gilbert, Charles, Almira (deceased) and Jay V. Mr. Ferris has never been a
politician, but he has taken some interest in public matters. He cast his first presidential vote for Gen.
William Henry Harrison during his second candidacy. He voted with the Whigs as long as that party
maintained its organization. On its dissolution and the formation of the republican party, he joined that
organization, and has voted the republican ticket since. Delaware County has not within its borders a
more industrious, upright, kinder-hearted citizen than David P. Ferris. Born to David and Hannah were:</div>
