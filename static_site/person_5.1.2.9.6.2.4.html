            <div class="person-text">(5.1.2.9.6.2.4) HENRY LEWIS ARMSTRONG born March 23, 1843 near Adams Corners, Putnam
Valley and died February 9, 1925 at his home on 240 Smith Street; married 1st June 23, 1886 in Squaw
Grove IL, Margaret Fox Barmore [dau of Mead &amp; Jane (Curry)] (sister to brother-in-law above) born
February 9, 1839 Lake Mohegan and died November 9, 1908; both buried Hillside Cemetery, Peekskill.
After Margaret’s death, Henry married, January 29, 1910, Evelyn Paulding Ward [dau of John M. &amp;
Susan (Wiley) Pauling]. Margaret received her early education at the public schools and later on at the
Brown Seminary in Peekskill. She taught school for several years in various localities and then went to
DeKalb County IL and joined her brother and sister living there. Soon after, Henry went west and there
met Margaret and they were married. They resided in Illinois for 5 years, and then returned to Peekskill
where they lived for one year on Washington Street, while Henry built their residence on Smith Street
and Hudson Avenue, where they resided for the duration. In early life, Margaret was a birthright
Quaker of the Society of Friends, her parents both members of that denomination of Christians.
Afterward during her married life, she united with the First M.E. Church with Henry and was a member
at the time of death. She was a member of the Van Cortlandt Chapter DAR; vice-president of the
Peekskill Hospital Association, member of the Dorcas Associated Charities, the Helping Hand

Association, and the Travelers Club. Henry was educated in the district schools of Putnam County and
Cortlandtown and Claverack Institute, at Claverack, Columbia County. He was busy on his parent’s
place in his youth; then conducted a farm in Illinois for 5 years, returning to the old home near Adams
Corners. After a year or two in agrarian pursuits, he and his brother, William, embarked in the coal
business, under the firm name of Armstrong Brothers. This partnership continued until William died
1883. After that Henry conducted it alone until sold to the Armstrong Coal Company on April 1, 1919.
He was elected a trustee of the Peekskill Savings Back in 1893, serving continuously until 1924 when
he retired owing to his health. He was chosen a director of the Westchester County National in 1907
and served continuously until 1922 when he retired on account of ill health. He was one of the first
subscribers to the stock of the Highland Democrat Co., when it was formed in 1903; he was one of its
first directors, and president of the corporation from its beginning. He was elected vice president of the
board of directors and was such at the time of his death. He was one of the largest stockholders, a
director and officer in the Putnam Spring Water Company, when that concern was very active in
Peekskill. He belonged to BPOE Lodge No. 744 between 1903-1921. He joined the Cortlandt Hook &amp;
Ladder Company in 1893 as an associate member and retained such membership until his death. He
spent much time in the Truck house where he was an ardent and expert domino and shuffle player. He
was a member of the committee on ways and means that raised money on the clubhouse and was one of
the largest contributors to the purchasing fund – the company never had a more loyal and enthusiastic
member. He was a staunch Democrat of the old school – he always voted, was interested in politics and
his party, but never could be prevailed upon to run for public office. He did however accept
appointment as Park Commissioner of the village and served long and efficiently. He was appointed by
the Park Board in 1904 to fill a vacancy. As his term expired he was reappointed from time to time,
either by the Park Board or the village Board of Trustees, as the case warranted until 1924, when after
20 years of service, on account of his death, was not renamed. He had been president of the Board for
about 15 years. He had given much of his time, energy and money to Depew Park; planned and
beautified Armstrong Island and Armstrong Lake in the park. He was an ardent sportsman – fly-fishing
and hunting. He was one of the original Duderberg Club organizers, an officer at times and one the
enthusiastic and sustaining members until the club was dissolved. He belonged to various Peekskill
organizations such as the old Peekskill Improvement Company, the Peekskill Business Men’s
Association, the Peekskill Board of Trade, the Cortlandt Cemetery Association as stockholder and
director, the Peekskill Gun Club, the Cortlandt Protective Association in which he was many years a
director, until it was dissolved, and other similar organization. He joined the First M.E. Church in 1872.
In 1876 he was made a trustee and served as such until 2 years before his death. At one time he was
superintendent of the Sunday school. He was a staunch supporter with money, time, talent and energy,
and a regular attendant. At one time he was probably the largest real estate owner in Peekskill. No
