(3.1.1.5.5.6.1.5) KATHERINE A. MILES born April 22, 1862 and died June 17, 1925; married
November 5, 1894 in Menard Co IL, Arthur S. Gray [son of Sylvester &amp; Harriet (Wood)] born June 29,
1860 and died August 30, 1910; both buried Oakland Cemetery, Petersburg IL (headstone photo)
&quot;The particulars of the sad accident, whereby Mr. Arthur S. Gray of this city lost his life, are
given in another column.
Mr. Gray born at Cuba, New York, 1860, being a descendant of one of the oldest and best
families of New York State. He was married to Miss Kate Miles of this city, daughter of James Miles,
Sr., in November 1894. The following January he moved to this place and has been a resident here
ever since, enjoying the confidence and respect of this community to an unusual degree. He was the
soul of honor, affable, cheerful, a splendid type of Christian manhood.
He leaves surviving him, his widow, two sons, Miles and Wood, aged 12 and 5 respectively, and
three sisters back in New York State. To the sorrowing relatives, especially to his wife the community
extends sympathy, and gladly would they bear a part of her sorrow if they could.
The funeral will occur this (Friday) afternoon at the Christian church at 2 o&#x27;clock, conducted by
Eld. B. H. Sealock, pastor of the church, of which the deceased was an active member. Interment at
Oakland cemetery.&quot;
&quot;While Mr. A. S. Gray, dairyman, was on his way home from serving his customers, Tuesday
evening, he met instant death on the crossing of the C., P. &amp; St. L. railway on North Main street, by
being run down by the southbound passenger, running nearly half hour late.
The crossing is a dangerous one on account of the buildings and brickyard, which obstruct the
view and the sharp curves on either side. The train being late was running quite fast to make up the lost
time. This is evidenced by the fact that the train was not stopped until it had run over one hundred
yards after the impact.
The body of the unfortunate man, which was not mangled, the main injury being on the back of
the head, was thrown only a few feet on the south side of the track, the horse which was also instantly
killed was carried a little farther, and dropped on the north side, the milk wagon was wholly
demolished.
Coroner&#x27;s Inquest. The inquest was held at Coroner H. E. Wilkins&#x27; office Wednesday morning,
resulting in the following verdict: &quot;We find that A. S. Gray came to his death by accidentally being
struck by passenger train No. 7, southbound, Chicago, Peoria &amp; St. Louis railroad at 7:12 p.m., August
30, 1920, at junction road crossing in Petersburg, Ill.&quot; Signed by Thos. Scott, James Arnold, Fred Kyle,
