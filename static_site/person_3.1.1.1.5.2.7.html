            <div class="person-text">(3.1.1.1.5.2.7) EDWIN PALMER FERRIS born July 13, 1829 Little Falls, Herkimer, NY; came with
his parents and family to Ripley County IN where he helped his father clear a small farm, and during
the winter attended the common schools. At about the time he became of age be went to the county seat
to attend the county seminary, but in a short time was promoted to be one of the teachers; afterward

attended a Commercial College and received a diploma therefrom; also began attending Franklin
College where he remained until 1854; during the same year he was elected County Surveyor of Ripley
County, serving two years; married December 31, 1854 in Versailles, Sibyl Foster Stevens [dau of
Jefferson &amp; Harriet F (Hill) Stevens] born February 22, 1833 OH. After his term as Surveyor had
expired and while working on the farm he spent all his spare time studying law; began the practice
thereof in 1858 in partnership with Hon. A. C. Downey, of Rising Sun, locating his office at Versailles;
soon secured a good practice; 1862 he was elected representative in the State Legislature; 1878 he
moved from Versailles to Shelbyville where he resided. He and Sibyl were members of the Presbyterian
Church and politically he was a Democrat. As a lawyer, he was a hard student and faithful to his client;
a fluent, fair argumentative speaker, never digressing from his case for the sake of oratorical display.
He always discouraged a multiplicity of suits, advising many clients to a private settlement of their
cases instead of resorting to the law, thereby often losing a prospective fee. He was one of the most
charitable lawyers to opposing witnesses, covering with the mantle of charity, contradictions in their
testimony, which makes a friend of one who might otherwise be an enemy. His long professional
experience and practice before the Supreme Court made him familiar with decisions of that tribunal of
justice, which generally helped him in his every day practice. Moved to Shelbyville and was referred to
as Judge; and born to them were 8 kids; 2 of which were:</div>
