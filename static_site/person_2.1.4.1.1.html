            <div class="person-text">(2.1.4.1.1) JONATHAN FERRIS born 1754 Greenwich CT and died July 7, 1834/36 Providence,
Saratoga, NY; married (possibly) Elizabeth Mead born January 3, 1755 and died July 16, 1833.
Jonathan served the Revolutionary War enlisting 1776 at Bedford NY in a Company of Rangers under
Captain Michael Townsend and served four months as a guard at White Plains, Westchester Co NY;
reenlisted 1777 for three months in Captain Richard Sackett’s Company, Colonel Ludington’s
Regiment, General Putnam’s Army; he served also in 1778-79 in Westchester Co Militia, about two
months of which was under Captain Moses St. John. He resided at Bedford NY during the War and
thence moved to Providence NY. In 1791, he was a member of the “Baptist Church of Christ” in

Providence. [This Jonathan is listed in Chaplain Ferris’ work as the Mead Fragment, since he was

his wife Elizabeth Mead as belonging to Peter &gt; Joseph &gt; Samuel &gt; Samuel II, so I have made the
transfer from a fragment to their place here based on that and for no other reason – a word to the wise.]
[Have also been told that there is a possibility the spelling for Jonathan could be Farris]. Born to him
and his wife were:</div>
