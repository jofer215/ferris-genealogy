            <div class="person-text">(3.1.2.3.5.1.9) EDDY FRANKLIN FERRIS (Photos) born May 2, 1838 Chazy, Clinton, NY and died
October 22, 1908 Bozeman, Gallatin, MT. Eddy moved to Denver in 1859, but when the Civil War
was declared, he returned to Fond du Lac WI and enlisted in the 14th Wisconsin Infantry Regiment.
The 14th was organized at Fond du Lac, January 30, 1862 to serve three years. The 14th left WI for St.
Louis MO, March 8, thence to Savannah TN; battles the 14th participated in were: Pittsburg Landing;
Iuka; Corinth; Siege of Vicksburg; Tupelo; Atlanta; Jonesboro; Lovejoy’s Station; Nashville; Rivers’
Bridge; and Spanish Fort. Eddy was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel, April 13, 1865. [Archive record
pending] After the war, he returned to WI and married, January 22, 1874 (in Corinne UT) Margaret
Schell Eastman [dau of Rev. George Burder Eastman] born September 4, 1848 Avon NY and died
December 19, 1889 Bozeman MT; both buried Sunset Hills Cemetery, Bozeman. They moved to Salt
Lake where he freighted on the Union Pacific as they built the railroad from Salt Lake to Butte MT.
Eddy was a partner of Sebree, Ferris, and White; bankers and dealers in hardware and agricultural
implements. Eddy’s business followed the construction route of the Utah and Northern Railroad. The
business required frequent moves along the construction line. In 1880 the couple moved to Red Rock
(present day Dillon) in hopes of settling down. However, both the climate and the environment for
permanent settlement was not to their liking and the couple moved to Bozeman in 1882. Once in
Bozeman, Eddy opened a store and built the Bon Ton Building. In the 1890’s Eddy’s brother, E. Myron
Ferris moved into the area and eventually purchased the Matthews Hot Springs. Ferris built onto the
property and for several years owned and operated the Ferris Hot Springs Hotel. On December 12,
1908 after his death, the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States, Commandery of the
State of Wisconsin presented a tribute to Lieutenant Colonel Ferris, certficate as follows: “Companion

Bozeman, Montana, under the auspices of the GAR and Masonic Order, from the Episcopal Church.
His record as a soldier and citizen was one to be proud of. He is survived by four daughters, three of
whom are living at Bozeman, Montana, and one at Butte, Montana, to all of whom this Commandery,
extends sincerest sympathy in this hour of bereavement.” Montana State University at Bozeman in the
Merrill G. Burlingame Special Collections has the Ferris Family Papers (1874-1926) including
numerous letters written by “Maggie” to her mother. These are interesting letters, but too numerous to
type here. Born to them were:</div>
