            <div class="person-text">(4.2.5.5.7.1.1.1.1.6) WILLIAM OWEN HIXSON born December 3, 1898 Tarkio MO and died April
21, 1974 Shenandoah IA; mail carrier Blanchard and Coin IA for 45y; Blanchard H. S., Tarkio College,
U of Nebraska-Lincoln; WWI Veteran served in Company E, 168th Infantry Div (Rainbow), 1917-19;
charter member American Legion-Blanchard; once employed at the Crain Hardware Store for several
years prior to becoming a rural mail carrier; married March 18, 1919-20 in IA, Margy Russell [dau of
Frank &amp; Ella (Eutenney) Russell] born December 14, 1901 Blanchard IA and died June 15, 1989
Clarinda IA; both buried Elmwood Cemetery, Coin IA. “The first daylight raid by American units was
made by two companies of the 168th Infantry of the Rainbow Infantry Division. This raid had for its objective
the destruction of a strong point in the third line of enemy trenches. The Germans became alarmed before the
raid started and heavily shelled the American trenches. Despite losses in killed and wounded, and though it was
the first time they had ever been under any kind of fire, the companies moved to the attack exactly on time,
penetrated to the enemy&#x27;s third line, destroyed the strong point and returned with prisoners. In addition to other
troubles during the raid, they were attacked several times by low-flying German airplanes, the machine-gun fire
of which added to their losses. Though it was not his duty as chief of staff of the division, Colonel Douglas
MacArthur went along on the raid. The 168th Infantry, then the 51st Iowa Infantry, was one of the regiments
which fought in the Philippines in the division commanded by General Arthur MacArthur, the father of Colonel
MacArthur. General MacArthur started his career at the age of eighteen as a private of infantry in a Wisconsin
Infantry regiment in the Civil War.” Other info on the Internet - Born to them were:</div>
