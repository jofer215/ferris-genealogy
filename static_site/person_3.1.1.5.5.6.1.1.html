            <div class="person-text">(3.1.1.5.5.6.1.1) MARY JANE MILES born March 19, 1848 and died January 22, 1917; buried
Oakland Cemetery, Petersburg IL; married October 31, 1867 in Menard Co IL, Almon G. Hurd born
March 13, 1838, Sunapee, Sullivan, NH

&quot;Mary Jane Miles, daughter of James and Anna Miles, deceased, born in Petersburg, March 19,
1848. She was the oldest of six children, four of whom survive her, Mrs. Lizzie Wood, George and
James Miles and Mrs. Kate Gray all of Petersburg.
She was married to Almond G. Hurd of Petersburg, October 31, 1867, who died December 5,
1908. To this union were born two children, Harvey Hurd, who died 15 years ago, and Iona Antle
Hurd, now Mrs. H. S. Peterson.
Some forty odd years ago, during a meeting held in Petersburg by Elder D. R. Lucas, she
confessed Christ as her Savior and was buried with him in baptism in the waters of the Sangamon
River. She united with the Christian church of Petersburg, and held fast to her faith in her Lord until
death.
Mrs. Hurd was for many years an active member of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union of
Petersburg, also a member of the Rebecca lodge.
She died at her home just west of the city, where she had spent most of her life, on Monday
morning, January 22, 1917, aged 68 years, 10 months and 3 days. Mrs. Hurd was the last one of the
family. She leaves to mourn her departure her bereaved daughter, Mrs. Peterson, and her sisters and
brothers, five grandchildren, other relatives and very many friends.
In her death the home, the church and the whole community have sustained a great loss.
The funeral services were held at the Christian church on Wednesday afternoon, conducted by
Rev. S. E. Fisher, assisted by Elder C. E. Smoot. Interment at Oakland.&quot;
&quot;[Almon G. Hurd], son of Hiram and Ester (Patten) Hurd, who are natives of New
Hampshire. The former born June 3, 1800, and the latter Dec. 22, 1804. They were married Jan. 26,
1826. They have now lived together for over fifty-three years. They came west with their family in
1855. Almon is the only son and born in Sullivan Co., N. H., March 13, 1838, and has always resided
with his parents, and, since their coming west, has superintended the affairs of his parents. He married
Mary J., daughter of James Miles, a prominent pioneer of Menard Co. They were married Oct. 31,
1867. They have a son and a daughter. Mr. Hurd owns 160 acres.&quot;
&quot;Almon G. Hurd, for fifty-four years a resident of Menard county and one of its prominent and
most respected citizens, closed his eyes in death last Saturday evening, at his home just west of the city
limits.
Mr. Hurd born near Concord, New Hampshire, March 13, 1838. His father, Hiram Hurd, moved
west in 1854, settling on the farm, which afterward became the property of the son. In early manhood
Almon engaged in teaching school, but the greater part of his life was spent in farming upon the old
homestead. On October 31, 1867, he was united in marriage with Miss Mary J. Miles, a daughter of
the venerable James Miles. Two children - a son and a daughter - were born to them, Harvey and Iona.
The son died in August 1901. The daughter is the wife of Hardy S. Peterson, and with her husband has
continued to live at the old home since her marriage.
Mr. Hurd became a member of Salem lodge of Odd Fellows more than forty years ago. In 1875
he joined the Christian church and was an active member thereof until his failing health no longer
permitted him to go about. He was a companionable man, of strictest integrity, a good neighbor and
sympathetic friend, and devoted to his family. In his death the community sustains the loss of one of its
best citizens. He is survived by his wife, the daughter above named, and three grandchildren.

The funeral occurred from the residence at 1:30 o&#x27;clock Monday afternoon, Elder W. M. Groves
conducting the services, after which the remains were conveyed to Oakland cemetery, where they were
consigned to earth with the burial rites of the Odd Fellows order.&quot; Almon spent most of his adult
years in agriculture and was also a partner of Horace Alanson Wood in their nursery business. During
his early years, he taught school at Little Grove and Brush College, also at Tice and Little Brick.
