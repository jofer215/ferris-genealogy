            <div class="person-text">(4.6.1.2.3.1) SAMUEL DRAKE LOCKWOOD (#1376) born August 2, 1789 Pound Ridge NY and
died April 23, 1874 Batavia IL. When Samuel was 10 years old, his father died and his mother was left
with three young children and with but slender means for their support. By this event his plans for a
liberal education were broken up and he was thrown very much upon his own resources. In 1803, he
went to Waterford NY, to live with his uncle Francis Drake, a lawyer there, and remained in his family

as an errand boy and law student until February, 1811, when he was licensed to practice law, and
opened an office in Batavia NY. The next year he removed to Auburn, and continued in the practice of
law there until the fall of 1818, holding during a part of that time the office of Master of Chancery. At
that time his constitution (never very strong) seemed so broken down by disease and constant
application to business that his physician advised him to give up his profession and engage in some
outdoor employment, as the only way of regaining even his former degree of health. This advice,
together with the glowing accounts of the great far west then prevalent, induced him to change his
residence and seek his future home in the new State of Illinois, in the fall of 1811. At the second
session of the Illinois Legislature, which was held at Vandalia in 1821, Mr. Lockwood was elected
Attorney-General of the State, and his acceptance of this office resulted in a residency at Edwardsville
IL. In 1823 he was, very unexpectedly to himself, nominated by Governor Cole to the office of
Secretary of State, but soon after accepting that office he was greatly surprised by receiving from
President Monroe a commission appointing him receiver of public moneys at the land office at
Edwardsville. This commission was, in itself, as undesired as it was unsought, the salary of Secretary
of State was small and payable in depreciated currency, while the salary of receiver was liberal and
payable in gold, and had attached to it, a percentage of receipts. He accepted the commission. He was
elected Judge of the Supreme Court, 1824-48. Morgan County delegate to the Constitutional
Convention, 1848; appointed trustee of the land department of the Illinois Central Railroad, 1851-until
his death. Moved to Batavia in 1853. He married, October 3, 1826, Mary Virginia Stella Nash [dau of
John, of Prince Edward County VA] born June 30, 1800 and died March 27, 1875, Batavia. Born to
them were:</div>
