            <div class="person-text">(5.1.2.6.5.6) HENRY FERRIS born November 7, 1815 Benton, Yates, NY and died June 21, 1900
Avoca (Wallace, Steuben Co) NY as the result of a fatal driving accident; buried Highland Cemetery,
Avoca NY. Henry and his sister, Phebe, bought two farms of the Land Grant at Bath. They cleared them
from virgin timber and put up log buildings. Henry was making his payments, but Phebe’s husband,
Dave Thomas, moved out in the night, and Henry was saddled with both farms, and nearly lost both, as
his children were young and his wife Laura Ann was by that time an invalid, which she remained to
their death at an age of 62. He weathered the crisis with hard work, and later owed just $800.00, which
he’s about to pay, as he had marketed 800 bushels of grain to a dealer in Cohocton. When the grain was
all hauled, he asked the dealer for his pay, he dealer had taken bankruptcy, and would not even trust
Henry to a pound of tea. Again he thought he would lose his farms. But, he was honest, hard working
man, so his credit was good and he was allowed time to pay it. He kept it until about 1883-84, when he
sold it, and retired to Bloomerville, near Wallace NY, where he lived next to his daughter, Susan Hyler,
in a small house. She helped and did many things for him like baking bread, washing clothes, etc. He
was driving on the hill west of the village of Avoca, when his horse became frightened and ran,
overturning the buggy and throwing Henry out. He struck his head and shoulders and was rendered
unconscious. He was carried to a nearby farmhouse and died soon thereafter; married c1838 in
Steuben Co, Laura Ann Andrus [dau of Charles &amp; Lucinda, of VT] born May 30, 1816 Onondaga Co
NY and died December 13/19, 1876 Bloomerville, Avoca, Steuben, NY (she lost her life when their
children were very young); buried with Henry. Born to them were:</div>
