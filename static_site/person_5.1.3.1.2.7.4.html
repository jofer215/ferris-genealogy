            <div class="person-text">(5.1.3.1.2.7.4) HIRAM GANO FERRIS (Photograph) born May 13/18, 1822 Howard, Steuben, NY
and died August 20/22, 1893 Carthage IL; the town of Ferris which is situated in Rock Creek
Township, four miles north of Carthage, derives it name from Hiram, who came with his parents from

Steuben Co NY to Illinois in 1832, landing at what is now Hamilton, having first landed at Traders’
Point now Keokuk, on the 13th of December of that year. Hiram was educated at Knox College IL,
attending 1846-50 (listed as a non-graduate). After his studies he crossed the plains to California,
joining the Gold Rush, taking 76 days in travel, arriving in Placerville CA on July 9, 1850. He resided
in Placerville, Sacramento, Yuba Dam and Yreka. In the winter of 1851-52, he was appointed by the
Legislature of the State of California as one of the commissioners to organize the county of Siskiyou.
After serving on this commission until their work was finished, he was elected County Clerk of that
county, in which capacity he served for two years. In 1856, he returned to Hancock County IL via
Panama and New York City. Having previously read and studied law, he made application to the
Supreme Court of Illinois for admission to the Bar, which, after undergoing an examination by that
court, was granted. Soon afterward, Hiram formed a partnership with Hooker &amp; Edmunds, Attorneys,
at Carthage IL, under the name of Ferris, Hooker &amp; and Edmunds. The firm was dissolved in 1863,
and the business continued by Ferris &amp; Hooker. In 1864, this firm was also dissolved, Mr. Ferris
continuing it until 1865. During this year he associated himself with F. M. Corby and organized a
banking institution, the firm being Ferris &amp; Corby. They were largely interested in real estate
transactions. This banking institution formed the nucleus of what is now The Hancock County National
Bank, of Carthage, which opened its doors for business as a national bank, June 5, 1865. Hiram was at
once elected President of the bank, continuing to hold the position for many years. Hiram was a Royal
Arch Mason and Knight Templar and was a member of the Masonic order starting in January 1850. In
politics, he was a Democrat and during the Civil War, was firm in support of the Union cause. He
served four terms as President of the Board of Trustees of the town of Carthage IL. For many years in
Hancock County there was an organization known as the Hancock Pioneer Association, which held
annual meetings. Their fifth one was held in Carthage at the Courthouse and several hundred people
were present. The following was reported in the Carthage Republican (1873). The first speaker was the
Honorable H.G. Ferris – “This is in my judgment an occasion of great interest, as it enables us to look
back to a period when there were few inhabitants, when this was a wild, uninhabited prairie with few or
none of the comforts we now enjoy. The people who settled here in that early day are here represented.
You have met to revive these early recollections and renew old acquaintances and old feelings of
fraternity and affection. And it is our pride as it is our duty, to consider these old citizens as honored
land-marks in the growth and history of our great country; to revere them as pioneers and men and
women worthy of our affectionate regard. Those who were in the prime of their life thirty and forty
years ago are now in the sere and yellow leaf. They are the representatives of other pioneers, who
having done their honored work have passed away, and we soon will follow. Therefore friends, we
ought to look back and derive instruction for the present. This country is yet comparatively in its
infancy. The area of our available soil could support a population ten times larger than ours and make
this one of the most delightful and best spots on the globe. As time advances we see the marks of time
upon our several faces, admonishing us that we are passing away, and doubtless with some duty
unfulfilled. Let this admonish us that we leave the impress upon all around us - upon the rising
generation - that good and honest government is necessary to human happiness, and that they, and we
must improve upon what was good of the past and reject all its errors. We are but a fraction of a great
nation, which is making greater moral and intellectual strides than any other people on earth. We of the
Anglo-Saxon race, and I include the German as well - have shown our predominance intellectually and

in commerce during the past 100 years. Go where you will - in any part of the earth - where you see
the Anglo-Saxon race in conflict with any other race, you will find the other race go under. Go to
California and observe the contrast. The original inhabitants of that country who owned the soil haven’t
the intellectual and moral power to contend with our own race. They cannot hold their own. The
grandees of old time California do not own an acre of the soil. This is particularly noticeable at Los
Angeles where they fiddled and fandangoed and rode fine horses, while the earnest, plodding, busy
Anglo-Saxons have been absorbing their inheritance. It is labor that moves the world. Labor,
commerce and trade go hand in hand, and are like necessary to each other. Plowing and teaching are
alike honorable, so with trade and commerce. No calling should be prejudiced by another. Let us be
careful not to deride or prejudice any branch of labor or trade. It is not right, it is not honorable; but let
us be opposed to anything that does not do business in an honest and legitimate way. It is wrong to
build up or harbor prejudice against any honorable branch of trade. I see that there is at this time a
tendency that way. I hope it will not succeed, but that it will be frowned upon; that it will not succeed.
How necessary it is that those who come after us should be instructed to deprecate and condemn
wrangling and disputes. Let them go forward with a fixed determination to bear their part in the interest
of the world of mankind’. He married, August 20, 1857 at Hillsdale, McDonough, IL Julia Esther
Holton [dau of Isaac and Phoebe (Arnold) Holton] born March 28, 1836 Hillsgrove IL and graduated
from Knox College 1856. Born to them were:</div>
