            <div class="person-text">(3.1.2.2.2.2.4.3.1.3) MILDRED FERRIS OLIVER (Photo) born October 10, 1909 Sherburne NY and
died April 15, 1993 N. Brookfield NY; married June 16, 1931 at Stockwell NY, Clyde C. Head born
August 14, 1906 Madison Co NY and died January 4, 1984 Hamilton NY; from the autobiography of
Mildred Oliver Head {courtesy of Kathleen Fort}: ‘I born in Sherburne, Chenango County, on October
10, 1909 to Henry Elbert Oliver and Rachel M. Ferris Oliver on a farm owned by George Royace and
wife Lena. I had one sister, Harriet Lena Oliver (1902-1980), and one brother, Walter Bradly Oliver
(1904-1947). My mother had her mother, Emma Pudney Ferris, and father, William Ferris. William
Ferris&#x27; father was in the Civil War and died in Libby Prison...his name is Caleb Ferris and he is buried
in Smyrna, NY. My mother had two sisters: Lena Ferris (1887-1925) who married Earl Conley... Earl
lived to be 100 years old. Lena &amp; Earl had two girls: Irena (died as a baby) and Dorthy Conley Clark.
Florence Ferris (1895-1926) who married Roy VanHousen. Florence and Roy had one boy: Billy
VanHousen. Earl and Roy each married again. My mother had one brother: Floyd Ferris who married
Clara... their children: Floyd Jr., Arvilla, Bob, Niel, Doris, Wilma, Emma, Dick, Bill, Marla and Toots
(died as baby). My father had two sisters: Jennie Oliver who married Ralph Cook... Jennie and Ralph
had Helen Cook and Edwin Cook. Hatty Oliver who married Arthur Wood. My father had one brother:
Davis Oliver... Davis had Ruth Sampson and Pauline Burt. When Grandma Oliver&#x27;s husband died in
1884, she moved to Sherburne, NY, so to be with her family, the Smiths. John Smith was her father.
She had her husband moved to Sherburne West Hill Cemetery... it cost $500. She bought a big lot with
a big stone for her family. So that is why my mother, father, brother and sister are all down there. Also
the others: Alta, Davis, Helen, Jennie, Ralph, Hatty, Arthur, Mary, Edwin and children. I born on a
Sunday morning after a band concert... my father had to drive the horse back to Sherburne to get Dr.
Gould. When I was two years old, we bought our first farm four miles north of Sherburne on Route 12.
I think we had about four head of cows. We lived there eight years. While there Walter broke his leg
while sliding. They had to take him to Dr. Sweet in Utica Hospital. Harriett and I pulled him off the
couch, which his leg was nearly knit... so he had to go back to Utica into Faxton Hospital... Dr. Sweet
had to break the leg again and wire it together. When Walter and my mother got back, I did not know
them. After that, Walter walked with a limp. While living on the farm, Christmas and Thanksgiving
was always at Grampa and Grandma Ferris&#x27;. We drove two horses on a big slay. One day I jumped out
and ma fell out into the snow. While traveling to the Baptist Christmas Program, we saw a star fall to
the ground and burn. It made a big hole in the ground. We had a slay full of people we had picked up
on the way. When the girls (Harriett and Ruth) tried to get me to sleep by wheeling a big wicker
carriage in the road, I would pretend I was asleep when they peeked in. I was eight years old before I

started school because I had many epileptic fits... just as I would go to sleep or wake up I would pass
out... two years of it. Then Dr. Gould removed my adenoids and tonsils. Many people said I had
worms and they chocked me. Ma used turpentine under my nose then on my throat, and I would come
to. In 1918 the armistice was signed. We kids were at school. Our teacher, Miss Kasey (who stayed at
our house) Walter, Harriett and I got the horse and drove to Sherburn on the back road... there was pa,
ma, Grandma in the Jewett. Sherburne had a big bon fire this being a big celebration. I was there and I
remember it well. My father was a rough person... he would get mad at times. We would want to go to
a church party, and he would hide the harness so we could not use the horse. Harriett used to have bad
headaches and she said he threw a stick of wood and hit her in the head. But he was good to me. I
could do anything. One day when I was about 11 and Walter was 16, my Uncle Roy VanHousen came
to our school at Ferman Mills and took us in a car with mama... we were leaving home. We went to
live with a cousin in Gilbertsville and went to school there. One year later we went to live with
Grampa and Grandma Ferris. I went to school on Sherburne West Hill. Walter quit school and worked
on many different farms. By this time Harriett had to quit school because her eyes were bad. She
became a working cadet and worked on farms. When I was 13 my dad bought a chicken farm in
Stockwell, and we all got back together. He hugged me real tight... he was so glad to see me. I went to
school in Stockwell and Harriett went to Utica School of Commerce. Walter continued farm work.
Harriett became a bacteriologist and worked in Oxford testing mild for Bordens. So when I got
through the eighth grade, I went to Oxford to High School. At one time my mother worked in the
Sherburne Mill. Someone had to drive her down with the horse and wagon (or cutter)... that was my
job. I had to take her to the Mill and then go back and walk to school. When I got home from school it
was back to the Mill. One day they hitched the black horse on, and I had a fit because I could not
handle that one. Mama worked and paid for Harriett&#x27;s schooling at Utica School of Commerce. At 18
years old I quit and went to work in the Sherburne Inn. While I worked in the Inn I lived with my
Grandmother, Mary (Smith) Oliver. I remember she had a car... the Jewett... no one had a license but
my dad, so I took lots of trips. One time we took a big tent but we had not place to set it up... so we
came to a vacant barn, drove the car part way in and set the tent up. We were on our way to Orid, NY,
to see a Smith cousin who had a son in the Navy Band in Washington, DC. They also had a Mulberry
tree... boy, were they good... just like Blackberries! We also visited Watkins Glen and home again...
One trip was to Delta Dam. At 17 years old I met Clyde Head at Young Peoples Baptist Church in
North Brookfield. There was a big group of young people that met Sunday nights for Christian
Endeavor. We took turns leading. We had a special book and learned a lot. It was very good. Clyde
had been going with Alberta Pierson for two years... Alberta and I used to ride horse back together a
lot... she and I enjoyed coming over to see Clyde... Cart and I went along in the back set to have a way
to go. We went to Young People’s at night, movies, baseball games and lots of places. At Bert’s
graduation from North Brookville Union School held at the North Brookville Community Center she
would not go home with Clyde... she told him her dress would get dirty in his truck and that Clayton
Helmer had asked her to go home with him... Clyde actually had his grandfather&#x27;s big car... not the
truck... SO he asked me to ride home with him. I was ready and mom said yes! Well, Bert lost him
and I got him! We had a nice ride home... we went together from then on... Bert eventually married
Clayton. Then we were all happy. Bert and Clayton (Ruth Avery&#x27;s brother) lived in Hamilton and had
one girl, Janette. Clyde and I had many nice Sundays together. One Sunday in 1926 as I was driving

the horse home from church Clyde stopped and asked me to go to the Utica Airport with him in the
Mercury. I gave ma the lines and went with him... we had our first airplane ride in a Curtis Robin...
nice! My parents were pretty scared. I was baptised in North Brookfield Baptist Church at 18 years old
in 1926 or 1927. My father and I came into the water at the same time. Rev. York was pastor. In 1927
and 1928 I attended Morrisville College for homemaking (dress making &amp; millinery, some cooking and
manual training). In 1928 there were 108 graduates in my class. For two years I was 4H leader of the
girls. Clyde and I went many places with his mother. Sometimes we took my mother also and always
Junior, Clyde&#x27;s little brother. We visited Risely&#x27;s in Rochester and on to Niagara Falls. We visited the
North Woods with Hatty and John Sweet and Neva... We went into the Catskills. We went together for
five years until one of Clyde&#x27;s cousins got married (Helen Cook and Harlan Hibbard 6/26/30)... Clyde
did not want to be the first one to marry. On June 16, 1931, Clyde and I were married at my home in
Stockwell at high noon. Harriett and Carlton stood up with us. Those present were: Mr. &amp; Mrs. Henry
Oliver Walter &amp; Harriett Oliver, Mrs. Neva Head, Carlton and Junior Head, Mr. &amp; Mrs. William Ferris,
Pauline Scott, Rev. &amp; Mrs. George Vinson and daughter Edna (officiant), Song: When Your Hair Turns
to Silver. After the wedding dinner, Clyde&#x27;s father, Linn Head, brought the Dodge over with the
windows down and Cart took out the keys... we sat there until it was all trimmed up... old shoes and
all. Then we drove south and they followed us to North Norwich and left. We drove on to Oxford
where we changed clothes and took the stuff off the car. But the man knew Harriett and put the old
shoes back on. We stayed in PA the first night... it was cold. We asked for ice cream for supper and
they had none till July 4th. We went on to Philadelphia to a ball game... Connie Mack was manager.
Then we went on to Maryland... ferried across the Delaware River and stayed in Delaware. Then we
went on up to Atlantic City and walked on the boardwalk by the ocean. Then we went on to New York
and stayed near Albany... then back to Bridgewater... Clyde&#x27;s dad met us in the road. There was a ball
game. We had a good life. I always went to the milk station to Hubbardsville. We were married five
years when June came in 1936 at my mother&#x27;s in Stockwell. Clyde was trustee of the school district.
Miss Louise Mory was our first teacher to board with us. She would go to the barn and walk home
with Clyde and make me mad. She finally married Ed Reed (Radziski)... he was a graduate of
Colgate. One of his first jobs was in Sears in Albany. They told him to change his name in business...
no one could say it or spell it. Cart, Carol, Clyde and I had a good time in Albany. In 1939 my mother
rented a house in Norwich and took in borders. She had twelve men who worked on the road. She
gave them two meals at the house and put up their lunches in a pail. My daughter, June, was three at
the time. Another time she took in people who were sick or old or pregnant... June born over there...
Dr. Battles came and stayed all night. Another time she worked in the old ladies home in (Pratt Nution)
Sherburne and also in Waterville Home for homeless ladies. When Clyde and I were first married,
Clyde and Cart had just taken over renting the farm. Clyde and I lived at the tenant house for eight
years and moved to the corner to take care of Grandma Adalaid Head. One of the boy’s first jobs was
to buy a tractor... It was an Oliver Ro Crop with Skeleton wheels and it did a lot of work. We still had
horses and Clyde did a lot with a horse team. Bess, Babe, Bert &amp; Buster... Clyde&#x27;s $1,000 Team he
called them. I think it was Babe that had a little cart... what fun to teach him to work. We went to
church, but the children were all different. Grandma Head was babysitter then (in those days they were
just Grandma not babysitters) She kept June quiet by whispering in her ear about animals. D. played
with money from his hand to your hand. But R. was an squealer... I spent time in the car with him. We

were interested in church... later the children sang in the choir as did Clyde and I. Clyde was Deacon
for many years until Carol decided someone else needed the job. That was a bad hurt for Clyde... he
did not take the interest any more... O! Yes... we still went to church. I was a Sunday School teacher.
But I gave it up as I liked to go to Sunday p.m. baseball games where Clyde played second base. In my
life at North Brookfield Baptist Church, I played the organ, taught Sunday School class, Bible School,
sang in the choir and still do in 1991.We also had a band: Clyde -- Trombone, Cart -- Trumpet, Me -Alto Horn, Carol -- Piano, Ruth Baliy -- Claranet, Bud Ramsdell -- Trumpet, Jake Ramsdell -Trombone. We had a teacher for a year or more. The boys played in Hubbardsville and Deansboro...
and of course we all played at the Community Hall. We also put on plays -- one was &#x27;Deaon Dubs of
Sargum Center&#x27;. We put that one on N. Brookfield Chadwicks. Clyde did not take part, but he took me
to practice. When we put on the four-act play, I was the cut up. We always did Christmas plays at
church. Now the children are so busy at school now or else no one has time to get them ready. It takes
a long time and takes away from the Bible teaching. You need to start a Christmas program and play in
October. I think it is good... you are still learning of Christ in his day. I guess old thing pass away and
new things come up. Born to them were 3 children, one of which was:</div>
