            <div class="person-text">(3.10.1.2.1.8) JOHN PECK born September 11, 1780 Stanford NY; went with his father to the
Chenango Valley in 1795/1804 and there married August 20, 1801 Sarah Ferris (3.1.2.2.3.5). John early
commenced preaching and in 1804, settled in Cazenovia NY, as a Baptist minister, and resided there
until his death. “He was a distinguished minister of his denomination, among the foremost in its
religious and benevolent enterprises, and eminent for his devotion to pastoral duty, his fervid eloquence
and his conservative theological tendencies. John died December 15, 1849 in New York city, being
there on a temporary visit.” “Gentle and Winning in Manner, was John Peck, in youth, the active Pastor
of Caznovia. He touched the tenderer chords in the heart with a persuasive power, which often effected

grave and earnest, there was a heavenly-mindedness in conversation and prayer, an unaffected incerity
in his discourses, and a weeping compassion in his appeals, which carried conviction to the conscience
and disarmed all opposition. He was wise in winning souls, and revivals were continually around him.

power in the hearts of his breathen. Love was the element he breathed and it was diffused all around
him.” Born to them were:</div>
