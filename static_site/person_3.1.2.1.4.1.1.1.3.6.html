MI; married July 2, 1903 Daniel S Moore
From Rockford Register, Wednesday, November 25, 1896
Arnold Baker, 16 year old son of Chas. Baker, residing about 2 miles west of Rockford, was assisting his father in threshing
on the farm of Mike Hayes, at Plainfield Village last week Wednesday. They were threshing corn and he stepped upon the
seperator to adjust the carrier belt when he lost his balance and fell and would have been ground to death by the rapidly
revolving cylinder had he not had the great presence of mind to grab the carrier and hang on until the machine could be
stopped. As it was his feet were mangled, and he was at once taken to the U. B. A. hospital. Both feet were amputated, the
heels being left. He bore the accident and operation with great fortitude, and everybody is pleased to think that it did not
result more seriously.
Rockford Register, Wednesday, June 8, 1903
A very pretty home wedding occurred at the home of the bride&#x27;s father, Mr. Daniel S. Moore, in Rockford, Thursday
evening, July 2nd, when his youngest daughter, Mabel C., was united in marriage to Mr. Arnold E. Baker in the presence of
about sixty relatives and friends. To the strains of Medelsohn&#x27;s wedding march, played by Miss Ella Tuttle, the bridal party
entered the parlor and took their places in a corner which had been tastily decorated. Rev. C. Finster, of Grand Haven,
pronounced the impressive marriage service, during which &quot;Annie Laurie&quot; was softly rendered on the piano. The bridal
couple were attended by Miss Christena Baker, as bridesmaid, and Mr. Volney Baker, as best man, sister and brother of the
groom. The bride was becomingly gowned in cream silk, and the mercerized pongee. After hearty congratulations by the
company dainty refreshments of ice cream and cake were served at small tables on the lawn by the Misses Leola and
Beatrice Seeley and Bessie and Blanch Whittall, all being neices of the bride. The lawn was tastily arranged and with

Chinese lanterns made a very pretty effect. Many beautiful and useful presents were received. Mr. and Mrs. Baker expect to
soon occupy their new home, formerly occupied by the groom&#x27;s parents, but which has been remodeled in view of this
event, and where they will be &quot;at home&quot; to their friends after August 1st. Among the out of town guests were Mr. and Mrs.
Neithauner and Mrs. Eva Hannell, of Grand Rapids, Mr. and Mrs. Lewis Moore and Mr. and Mrs. David Moore, of
Oakfield.</div>
