            <div class="person-text">(5.1.3.2.1.3.4) EDWIN FERRIS born December 15, 1833 Greenwich (Mianus) CT and died at his
home at No. 240 Claremont Avenue, Montclair NJ, March 24, 1920. Edwin obtained his education in
the schools of his native town. He moved to New York City at age 15, where he made his home with an
aunt. At the age of 17 he entered the business world as an employee of Benjamin Staff &amp; Company,
producers of and dealers in salt, with headquarters at No. 185 Washington Street, NYC. This was the
beginning of a long and prosperous business career, for he remained with the concern, and only a
comparatively few years later became the sole owner of the interest. Following his purchase of the
interest he remained in the same building for a period of 54 years as the head of his own firm, under the
title of Edwin Ferris &amp; Company. He was largely successful, but his achievements were recognized as
wholly worthy, for he never took an upward step on another’s disadvantage, always giving his
competitors a fair field, always safeguarding the welfare and happiness of his employees. He gave the
world such a history of high endeavor and eminent usefulness as is all to rarely seen in the business
world. In all the life and work of Edwin, his religious convictions governed his every act. A firm
believer in the divinity of God, he acknowledged fully the brotherhood of man, and the responsibilities
devolving upon him. Approaching his position as a member of the Christian family and the head of a
happy home, he gave largely of his time and means to the advancement of Christian effort in many
lines of activity. His eager and forward-looking attitude in all that pertained to work of this nature led
to his being sought frequently for aid, either as an individual or as a member of some group of workers.
He was a member of Dr. George B. Cheever’s church in NYC for many years covering the period of
the Civil War. In this connection one of the leading daily newspapers of Newark, after his death,
commented, in part, as follows: “To be a member of Dr. Cheever’s church during the Civil War was to
be much identified with the stirring events of the time. It was from this “Church of the Puritans” that a
committee of 25 men went in a body to Washington to plead for the abolition of slavery long before the
emancipation proclamation. A few hours before they were to meet President Lincoln, Dr. Cheever
remarked to Mr. Ferris, who was in Washington at the time, that their petition was badly written. There
was no typewriting in those days, and Mr. Ferris copied it out in clear chirography. President Lincoln
made a characteristic remark about this committee when Dr. Cheever pleaded the cause of the colored

race, quoting freely from the body. ‘I have had all sorts of delegates, for all sorts of purposes’, Mr.
Lincoln said, ‘but never before have I had a delegation direct from the Almighty’. Later on, near the
close of the war, Edwin served as a member of the Christian Commission, delegated to special work
among the soldiers as they neared Richmond, and after the close of the war he was chosen to help
suppress the historic riot in NYC. It was by the methods of peace, however, that he bore a part in this
work, his frank man-to-man appeal to leading disturbers carrying greater force than more violent
measures. His work for and among men was not ended with the passing of war conditions. Becoming a
resident of Montclair NJ in 1871, he was the leading spirit in the organization of the local Young Men’s
Christian Association, his interest in “Y” work having been aroused not long before as a charter
member of the 23d Street branch of the Association in NYC. The Montclair organization first met in
the Pillsbury Building, and their activities comprised scarcely more than a reading room. This was
burned out, and the second headquarters, across the street, met the same fate. With the purchase of a
small church building from the Methodist Episcopal denomination, its removal to Fullerton Avenue
was accomplished, and the organization was maintained for a time on that site, adjoining the present
Crane’s Building. This work was of necessity discontinued and when the present Young Men’s
Christian Association was established a number of years later, Mr. Ferris became a member and was
deeply interested in its work until his death. Edwin was a Republican by political convictions, although
never an office seeker, rather declining public responsibility when it was urged upon him. He was a
staunch supporter of the temperance prohibition movement, and his joy in the final triumph of statutory
prohibition was the brightest light in the sunset of his life. Edwin attended the First Congregational
Church of Montclair until Trinity Presbyterian Church was organized, then he united with his church,
in which he served as an elder for years. In every branch of activity with which he was connected his
name counted for progress and uplift, and his loss was one of the saddest events in the early spring of
1920 in Montclair. He married, January 28, 1857, Catherine &quot;Kate&quot; Isabella Henshaw (3.6.1.4.2.1.2), “a
woman of beautiful spirit and charming personality”. In 1924, the living daughters resided in their
parent’s home. Born to them were [this was a hard luck line!]:</div>
