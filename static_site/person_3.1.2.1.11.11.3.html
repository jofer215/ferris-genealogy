            <div class="person-text">(3.1.2.1.11.11.3) JOSHUA FERRIS BORDEN born May 2, 1837; never liked his name for his
comrades called him ‘Josh’ and he went by the name ‘Jack’ and finally took the name, Jackson B.
Ferris. As his mother went back to live with her father after the death of her husband and Joshua was a
posthumous child, he was always known by his surname of ‘Ferris’; enlisted for service in the Civil
War and was killed at Gettysburg with the 141st Pennsylvania Regiment. [Jim - he is not listed in the
‘General Index to Official Army Register of the Volunteer Force of the United States, 1861-65&quot;.][The
141st Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment had a long and glorious history of campaigns during the Civil
War, but according to the Compendium of the War of the Rebellion, Regimental Histories, they were
not involved in the Battle of Gettysburg.] [I do not know where Chaplain Ferris got this information - I
will send for Joshua’s military records and see what I can find out.] A Wilbur Blakeslee Abel married
June 26, 1926, Elinor Lane Ferris, dau of Jackson B. and Cora I (Edwards) Ferris – don’t know if this is
the same Jackson B. Ferris – probably not because of the dates involved
Born to Margaret and her second husband, Van, were:</div>
