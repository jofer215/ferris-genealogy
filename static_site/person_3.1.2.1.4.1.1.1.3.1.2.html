MANY ATTEND COURT SATURDAY AFTERNOON
Fred Simmons&#x27; Trial Draws a Large Crowd in Town.
MANY CONJECTURES AS TO VERDICT - Jury said &quot;Guilty&quot; and the Case Will Be Appealed to Circuit Court.
The event of the season was the trial of Fred Simmons, Saturday. Mr. Simmons was charged with assault and battery on the
person of John Jewell, said offense supposed to have taken place Aug. 23 at Mr. Simmons&#x27; farm house in Algoma.
Considerable time was taken up with the selection of a jury and it was not until just before the noon hour that the court was
able to get down to business. Owing to the prominence of the parties and the publicity given the affair many men were taken
in the jury panel. The afternoon was taken up in examing witnesses and many old family quarrels were brought out. The
large crowd present listened to the stories of the several witnesses and many conjectures were made as to the result of the
jury&#x27;s verdict. Mr. Simmons was represented by Earl F. Phelps, formerly prosecuting attorney and the people&#x27;s side was
taken by Assistant Prosecuting Attorney Perkins. Justice Haskell&#x27;s part in hearing the trial was fair in all respects and neither
side had any complaints to make regarding his decisions. It was not until after six o&#x27;clock that the case was give to Messrs.

Frank Farr, J. R. Trask, G. A. Porter, E. S. Baker, J. R. Wonders and Jos. Miller, who comprised the jury and they shortly
afterwards brought in a verdict of guilty. Mr. Simmons was fined $50 and costs or 60 days in jail. He immediately took out
bonds for the appealing of the case to the circuit court with R. B. Squires and Neal MacMillan as bondsman.
