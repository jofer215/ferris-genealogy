            <div class="person-text">(1.1.4.1.1.7) RICHARD R. FERRIS (Photos) born August 7, 1822 Butler, Wayne, NY
and died May 28, 1904 Cheshire Township, Allegan Co MI; married April 19, 1851 at
Mishawaka IN, Hannah Mary Milburn [dau of Thomas &amp; Ann] born January 1, 1826,
England (February 1, 1824 Alston, Cumberland, England) (headstone says January 1,
1824) [came to US 1848] and died November 15, 1900 Allegan Co MI; both buried

Pearson Cemetery, Allegan Co MI. Upon his father’s farm, Richard was reared to
manhood, and in the district schools of New York partially received his education. He
began life for himself at age 18 and two years later sought a home in the West. In
Mishawaka IN, he worked in a sawmill yard and afterward was employed in harvesting.
Subsequently he spent 8 months as a farm hand in Cass County, then returned to
Mishawaka, where he attended a select school during the winter. In the spring he again
went to work in the mill-yard for $20 per month and boarded himself. He did the work
of two men and his employer, William Wilburn [brother of his future wife], seeing his
usefulness, made him a sawyer and he was afterwards given entire charge of the mill,
being there employed from the spring of 1845 until 1851, with the exception of ten
months in 1849-49, when he was a student at Notre Dame University. In 1850 he moved
to Michigan, and for one summer he was employed in a mill in Lawrence, Van Buren
County, after which he taught school in the winter of 1850-51. The following spring he
returned to Mishawaka and bought a one-eighth interest in a new steam sawmill. In
August after his marriage, he sold out and them moved to Lawrence, where he bought a
third interest in a mill, helped to rebuild it and followed that business in 1854. In then
again sold, and moved to his farm on Section 17, Cheshire Township, Allegan County.
Mr. Ferris settled upon a four hundred and eighty acre tract of wild land, eleven miles
from Allegan, and built a double log cabin. Indians were still frequent visitors in the
neighborhood, few roads had been cut through and the work of development and
progress seemed scarcely begun. In May, 1855, Richard began building a saw mill,
which he operated for a number of years, when it was totally destroyed by fire. He then
built about eighty rods from the old site, but the water afterward failed and he
discontinued its operation and began improving his farm. Since then he has given his
entire attention to agricultural pursuits and now has three hundred and eighteen acres of
valuable land, two hundred and forty of which are highly cultivated. He has cleared and
fenced his farm himself and added greatly to its value and attractive appearance by many
improvements. He pays considerable attention to the raising of fine grades of sheep and
draft and coach horses. His home, which was erected in 1860, is the finest residence in
the township and is the abode of hospitality. The members of the family hold a high
position in the social world and their friends throughout the community are many. Mr.
Ferris is a member of the Catholic Church. His wife belonged to the Congregational
Church in England, but of late years has been an active worker in the Methodist Church.
With school interests he has been actively identified, has given his children good
advantages, and two have been teachers. So efficient was he as member of the Board
that those who first opposed him were afterward vociferous in their entreaties for him to

continue in office. He cast his first Presidential vote for Henry Clay and supported the
Whig party until the organization of the Republican Party with which he has since been
identified. He is one of the prominent Republicans in this community and has fought
many hard practical battles, especially trying to get the party to embody temperance
principals. He served as Clerk in Lawrence Township, Van Buren County, was also
School Inspector, and in 1855 was elected Clerk of Cheshire Township. He held the
office of School Inspector here until the organization of the school districts. Elected as
Representative from his district, Mr. Ferris served in the Legislature in 1871-72, when
he declined renomination. During that time he helped elect Thomas W. Ferry to the
United State Senate, was Chairman of the Lumber Committee, a member of the
Committee on State Prisons and also of the joint committee to visit the penal and
reformatory institutions of the State. The cause of temperance ever found in him a
staunch advocate, and all social, educational and moral interests received his hearty
support. His public and private life are above reproach. He has been a faithful public
officer and a valued citizen of the community, who has done much for the upbuilding of
the county during his many years of residence here. He has the respect of his many
acquaintances and the warm regard of a large circle of friends. One source has these
folks as LDS. Born to them were:</div>
