            <div class="person-text">(3.1.2.3.1.1.3) AZUBA FERRIS born September 26, 1811 Clinton Co NY and died September 3, 1892
Mishawaka IN; married September 26, 1833 as his 2d wife, Jacob Mathais Galor born August 5, 1809
Rensselaer Co NY; came with his mother and step-father to Rising Sun, Ohio Co IN 1815 and to
Dearborn Co IN 1816; then 1835 to St. Joseph Co and drove the first wagon south of Mishawaka into
the heavy timber, where he labored hard and long in clearing up a farm, thinking, as others in those
days, that the prairie land was worthless; also engaged in the collier business for some time; as there
was a blast furnace at Mishawaka, he found ready market for all his timber that he turned into
charcoal. Azuba was, along with her sister, one of the last surviving members, of the First Baptist
Church of Penn Township. Jacob was elected a trustee of the Church and was involved in selecting
ground and erecting a house of worship; 1838 the society erected a small log house in which to
worship; B. J. Ferris was elected as the first Treasurer of the Church [Jim - I cannot identify him]
[Jacob&#x27;s first wife was Cynthia Crouch - wonder if she was a relative of Isaiah&#x27;s wife, Lucinda?]; and
born to Azuba and Jacob were 3 children, two of which were [note the name change]:</div>
