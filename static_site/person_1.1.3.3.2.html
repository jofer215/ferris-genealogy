            <div class="person-text">(1.1.3.3.2) BENJAMIN GILBERT FERRIS born 1802 Ithaca NY and died there 1893;
married May 26, 1830 at Ithaca, Cornelia Woodcock [dau of David &amp; Mary (Baker)
Woodcock] born c1809 Ithaca, Tompkins, NY and died there March 31, 1893; after
Benjamin finished college, he entered the law office of David Woodcock, his future
father-in-law; admitted to the bar, he began to practice and became District Attorney for
Tompkins Co., 1840-45; he was a fireman in the local fire department starting in 1828;
President of the Village of Ithaca 1841 and 1852; a member of the state legislature in
1851; and appointed Secretary of Utah Territory by President Fillmore 1853; Secretary
of Utah Treasury; Author of History of Utah and the Mormons. From the book:
Benjamin Ferris was called to the governorship of Utah Territory in 1852 by President
Millard Fillmore. Prior to his being given this responsibility, Ferris had been a lawyer
and local notable in Ithaca, New York. Cornelia accompanied her husband to Utah and
later wrote her own book recounting her experiences in the west. Ferris first published
his account of travels and experiences in the west in 1854. Two years later he revised
and expanded this text of Utah and the Mormons. The 1856 edition was the last one
published of his book and Ferris soon after slipped into obscurity. He is last mentioned
as having been in the Ithaca area in 1855. Perhaps he died soon after that. Ferris&#x27; account
of early Mormonism is a pedestrian presentation typical of the times. Despite his having
lived among the Mormons in Utah for several months, he was unable to solicit from
them much in the way of original and unique historical material on the rise and progress
of the sect. He adopts the Spalding-Rigdon explanation for the origin of the Book of

Mormon, adding little to the &quot;Spalding theory,&quot; except for his labeling Rigdon a
&quot;religious Ishmaelite&quot; -- a term other writers picked up and applied as well descriptive of
Rigdon&#x27;s pre-Mormon years. After a few years of law practice in New York City, he
returned to Ithaca where he spent the remainder of his years.</div>
