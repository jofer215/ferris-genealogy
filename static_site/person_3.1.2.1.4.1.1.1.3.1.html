            <div class="person-text">(3.1.2.1.4.1.1.1.3.1) EMMA MOORE born March 2, 1857 Courtland Township, Kent Co MI and died
May 26, 1937 at the home of her daughter, Bessie, at Algoma Township, Kent Co MI; buried Alogoma
Cemetery, Algoma MI; married September 12, 1875 in Cedar Springs, Kent Co MI, Thomas H Whittall
[son of Thomas &amp; Ann (Llewellyn) Whittall – both born in England] born September 9, 1853 Ontario

Co NY and died June 29, 1914 Algoma Township (actually died at Grand Rapids Hospital); died as a
result of a fall from scaffolding at his house; he came to MI c1858 with his parents; Emma and Tom
lived for sometime in Courtland Township, then moved to the farm in Algoma Township, Sparta where
they resided 50+ years; From Rockford Register April 14, 1907: Thomas Whittall having rented his
farm located on Section 17, Algoma, will sell at auction on April 22, 10 horses and colts, pair of mules,
2 fresh cows, 40 sheep with lambs, wagons, buggies and all kinds of farm implements, quantity of hay,
oats, rye, corn and 60-70 bushels of seed potatoes; From Rockford Register, March 6, 1913: T. H.
Whittall and wife of Algoma, returned last week from a four weeks visit at Cleveland, Ohio and other
places. Mr Whittal was sick one week in Cleveland. We just learned that while there his pockets were
picked while riding on the street car and he was relieved of quite a little change. We can’t say if that
was the cause of his being sick or not; he was a hard working member of the Grange, known
throughout the state among the members of that organization; he was a man who loved his country
home and not even the conveniences of the city or village life could tempt him to leave the farm; this
love for home was evidenced by his last words as he was being placed into the ambulance for the trip to
the city. After giving the house one lingering look he said, “Good bye, old house”; and born to them
