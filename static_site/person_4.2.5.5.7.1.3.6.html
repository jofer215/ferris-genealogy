thoughtfulness ministered in any way to him who loved him all so well in his life and whose sympathy
is a solace to those benefit; to the members of the GAR who so nobly responded to their comrade’s last
call, and whose simple, beautiful rites were most fitting and appropriate for the loyal heart now still; to
the local press correspondents who have accorded much space in their respective papers, and to the
dear minister whose beautiful words of hope and comfort fell like dew from heaven on our sorrowful
hearts – these lines are lovingly dedicated, with a fervent prayer that God’s choicest blessings rest upon
them one and all” - Mrs. G W Lane and children. Born to George and Sarah was:</div>
