            <div class="person-text">(3.1.1.6.2.3) ISAAC FERRIS (Rev.) (AFN: 8RLM-X5) born April 12, 1795/6 Lexington, Fayette, KY
and died December 22, 1860 Cincinnati OH; age 4y, Isaac was sent to live with his grandfather in
Hamilton Co OH and there learned the shoemaker and tannery trades under his Uncle
Abram (3.1.1.6.6). Disliking this work, he entered the blacksmith and the harness business and after a
5-year apprenticeship, began the manufacture of hames, a business that grew and prospered until his
death. Isaac was one of the founders and the first pastor of the Duck Creek Baptist Church; 1825
became a licensed preacher in the Baptist Church; ten years he preached at the Duck Creek Baptist
Church; afterward thirteen years pastor of the East Fork Church; also led the flocks at Newton,
Cloughs, Hammer&#x27;s Run, and elsewhere. During his pastoring, he still labored at his trades,
blacksmithing and farming. He was accustomed to manual labor and was an active, energetic man, and
in consideration of the arduous work performed was truly a great man at that time. Those who knew

him credit him with having a meek, humble disposition, and an unassuming manner. His mind was
clear; reasoning and understanding, deep; while his arguments and exhortations were very effective,
and upon great occasions, when aroused into action, the power of the man was most fully felt. He
married October 24, 1816 at Pleasant Ridge OH, Phebe (Phoebe) R. Marsh [dau of Samuel &amp; Hannah
(Miller) Marsh] born September 22, 1798 Essex Co NJ and died February 25, 1882 Cincinnati; both
buried in the Duck Creek Baptist Cemetery, Hamilton Co OH; see Photograph of Isaac Ferris home;
and born to them were:</div>
