            <div class="person-text">(3.1.2.3.1.1.1.4) WILLIAM BARTON born March 22, 1838 St. Joseph Co IN and died September 12,
1914 Peoria Township KS; age of 19y he went to Kansas; early in the Civil War he enlisted in
Company L., 16th Kansas Cavalry and saw active service. “The 16th did not see the hard service which
was the fortune of the older regiments formed. At the battle of the Big Blue, in the vicinity of Westport
MO, and in the pursuit of the retreating rebel army under General Price, the 16th bore an honorable
part, and gave proof of the same soldierly qualities that characterized the Kansas troops under all
circumstances of danger and peril. A part of the regiment was sent to the Plains in pursuit of Indians
during the summer of its organization and with this, and the exception before mentioned, the regiment
was performing post and escort duty during most of its term of service.” Owned 160 acres in Peoria KS
located in the SW corner of Township 16, Range 21, Section 19; after the CW he homesteaded in
Franklin Co on a farm 1 mile north of 68 highway from Briles School House or one mile south of New
