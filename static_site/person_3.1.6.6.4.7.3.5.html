            <div class="person-text">(3.1.6.6.4.7.3.5) JOHN ADAM ANDERSON “Addie” born July 16, 1871 in the old farmhouse in Rock
town outside of Golconda IL and died October 23, 1938 when he was hit by a car while walking on the
road outside Stonefort IL; buried Golconda Town Cemetery; married November 6, 1892 at Golconda,
Harriet ‘Hatie’ Towns [dau of James and Sarah (Yewell) Towns - their 13th child] born May 26, 1871
Lusk town, Pope Co IL and died April 1, 1920 Carrier Mills IL; buried with her husband. Hatie was a
brunette with gray eyes and coal black hair. Being overweight, her brothers nicknamed her ‘Dump’,
which she hated; but she remained ‘Dump’ to her brothers until she died. Addie and Hatie rented a little
house in Lusk near Harriet&#x27;s family, on top of a hill. She kept the house spotless and every spring she
moved the furniture outside and cleaned and aired the house. Hatie planted and tended a huge garden to
can food for the winter. She kept a cow, which she milked to make butter to sell, and they always
seemed to have a little money from the butter and eggs. She raised hundreds of chickens for eating and
selling. Every Saturday they would load the wagon and drive seven miles to Golconda where Hatie
exchanged her butter and eggs for other food or a due bill in exchange. Addie was five feet nine inches
tall, blue eyes and brown hair with a pleasant personality. He loved people and had many friends. He
farmed and doctored sick cows and horses in the community. He enjoyed trading horses and had a fine
reputation as a natural veterinarian, without license to practice. He raised just enough hay to feed their
animals, usually keeping a cow and two horses. They kept the horses to pull the wagon when they went
to town. After Addie&#x27;s mother died, they decided to move to Stonefort IL where his sister, Rosnia
Wilson, lived with her family. Soon after their daughter, Mabel, married, Addie and Hatie moved to
Carrier Mills, where Addie set up a blacksmith shop in the barn behind their house. There was a
worldwide epidemic of Spanish influenza in 1918-19 when 500,000 people died in the U. S. Hatie had
gone to East St. Louis, in 1919, to nurse Mabel’s family through the epidemic. Then the following year,
she contacted the flu and died. Born to them were:</div>
