            <div class="person-text">(1.1.4.3.5.4.6) PERRY FERRIS born (November 24, 1838) July 6, 1846 Philipstown,
Putnam, NY and died there September 22, 1897; buried in old cemetery at Mekeel’s
Corners near Routes 9 and 301 in Philipstown; enlisted August 14, 1862 at Cold Spring
NY to serve three years as a Private and on December 4, 1862 was mustered into Federal
service t Fort McHenry, Baltimore MD. At the time of his enlistment, the Company
Description Book, listed him as a 23 year old, 5&#x27;10 1/2&quot; tall farmer with brown hair,
hazel eyes, and a ruddy complexion. He was mustered out of service July 17, 1865 and
he returned to Cold Spring NY where he resided continuously and lived out the rest of
his days. His gravestone is inscribed, Perry Ferris, Co. I 6th N.Y.H.A died October 23,
1897 47 y - this is incorrect as he served in Company L and was 51 years old at the time
of his death. On December 17, 1883, Perry filed Application No. 502,161 for an Invalid
Veteran’s pension, which was never approved. In his application he claimed, and several
of his comrades confirmed, that on or about September 15, 1864 he was engaged in
cutting logs with an axe and when so engaged accidently cut the tendon of his right foot.
His axe swing was deflected by an overhead limb during the downswing causing him to
hit his right foot. No records of treatment or hospitalization could be found. Perry also
stated in his application that he has been lame in the affected foot, it being very weak
and as a result he was seldom able to wear a boot on that foot. He also alleged that in
May 1865 he became partially deaf in both ears near Petersburg VA. He married, first,
Amelia Heady who died, 1866, Matteawan, Dutchess County NY; second, in 1868,
Mary Elizabeth Miller at Cold Springs NY who died before Perry. Born to Perry and
Amelia was:
