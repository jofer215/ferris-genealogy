            <div class="person-text">(5.1.2.9.2.6.8.1) CORTLANDT CHRISTIAN born March 23 (27), 1867 Putnam Valley NY and died
there September 27, 1928; married November 17, 1907 at Putnam Valley NY Mary
Barger (5.1.2.9.2.1.7.9). Obituary, Putnam Courier, Carmel, NY, Sept. 28, 1928: Cortlandt Christian,
supervisor and republican leader of the town of Putnam Valley, died at his home on Oscawana Heights,
about 8:30 yesterday morning, Sept. 27, 1928, of heart trouble from which he had been a sufferer for
about a year. Death came to the well known resident while sitting in a chair following a night during
which he had difficulty at times to breathe. Supervisor Christian suffered a severe attack with his heart
last January, which confined him to his home for several weeks. During the spring and summer he was
greatly improved and active with his general store and farm activities as well as his official duties.
About three weeks ago he suffered another attack from which he did not recover. The deceased was a
son of James and Sarah Nichols Christian and born near the home in which he died, about 61 years ago.
He was reared on a farm and followed that occupation all his life, dealing extensively in horses and
cattle for some years. About 35 years ago he opened a general store at Oscawana Heights which he has
conducted continuously since then and he also opened a store on the shore of Oscawana Lake a few
years ago to supply campers and cottagers at the east side of the lake but in recent years this store has
been rented. Mr. Christian during his lifetime acquired considerable property in the vicinity of Lake
Oscawana, which he held at the time of his death. Mr. Christian has always been a staunch republican
and a party leader of his native town for many years. He served as assessor and tax collector of Putnam
Valley for several years, as under sheriff during the term of Sheriff Joseph Barry and was a witness
employed by the city of New York in some of its condemnation proceedings in the Croton watershed.
Recently he had served on a state road appraisal commission and last November was elected supervisor
of Putnam Valley. Mr. Christian&#x27;s wife, who before her marriage was Marie Barger died about ten years
ago. They had no children and surviving him are a sister, Mrs. William Silleck, of Peekskill, and one
brother, William of Danbury. Mr. Christian was a man well liked by all who knew him and had made a
large circle of friends during his long life Putnam Valley. News of his death reached the county seat
yesterday noon and the board of supervisors adjourned out of respect to him immediately after
convening yesterday and went to his home Putnam Valley. Mr. Christian attended the Tompkins
Corners M.E. church although not a member and was also a member of the Shrub Oak Lodge of Odd
Fellows. Interment will be made in the family plot in the Hillside cemetery.
Born to James Almzar Christian and his second wife, Sarah, were:</div>
