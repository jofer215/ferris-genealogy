            <div class="person-text">(3.6.3.2.2.1.2.6.12) VERNON AVERTRUE HILL born March 30, 1896 Marietta KS and died
December 13, 1970 Chatsworth CA; married September 27, 1918 in Los Angeles CA, Myrtle Barbara
Weiss (1894-1954). Vernon worked in a ship yard building naval ships in San Diego during WWI. He
became a carpenter and a builder. During the depression, he worked in the Nevada gold mines (off and
on) with his brother, Richard Angus Hill. During the 1930s, he worked for the Los Angeles City
Schools as a carpenter until then President Hoover declared that only one person in the family should
work because of the depression. He was laid off because Myrtle was a teacher in the school district and
it was felt that teachers were more in demand. He went to work for MGM building movie sets and he
was again laid off for lack of work. He then went to work for Pacific Redcut Homes building
apartment houses in the Wilshire District - work again ran out. He then started his own contracting
business but not much building was going on at that time. In the 40&#x27;s he started raising goats and
poultry (eggs). He sold the milk to a cheese factory and the eggs to a wholesaler. From 1942-46, he
worked at the Van Nuys Airport as a fireman. From that time on he did carpentry for a period of time.
After Myrtle died he went to work for Garmen Goat Diary as a handyman. Born to them were:</div>
