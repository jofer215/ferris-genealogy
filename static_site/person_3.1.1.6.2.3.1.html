            <div class="person-text">(3.1.1.6.2.3.1) SAMUEL MARSH FERRIS (AFN: 8RLN-FP) (Photograph) born October 12, 1817
Linwood on the old Ferris homestead at Mt. Lookout, Hamilton Co, OH and died there May (March)
14, 1903; early life was spent on the farm and in his father’s shop, where he learned the trade of
blacksmith; married November 1, 1838 Mary Zorelda Ferris (5.1.3.8.2.3) (AFN: 8RLN-RF).
[Interesting comment by Ms. Scofield here - Samuel and his people were characteristically blue-eyed,
fair skinned and light complexioned, while those of his wife&#x27;s people were dark complexioned with
dark hair and eyes.] For two years after the marriage, they lived at Mt. Lookout, and then moved to
Linwood. Samuel&#x27;s first business venture was as a village blacksmith, which together with wagon
making, he followed for many years with much success. In 1865, he took his two brothers into
partnership and built a large, new brick factory, thoroughly equipped with modern equipment; S. M.
Ferris &amp; Co. He built the first freight cars on the Little Miami Railroad and manufactured hames and
saddles. He was connected actively with the underground railroad and was one of the organizers of the
Republican Party in his county; was town treasurer for nearly 30 years and helped organized his school
district, followed by serving as school trustee for 24 years. In 1833, he was taken into the Duck Creek
church, three miles north of Columbia, in which he was always a most active and useful member. In
this church he was clerk for 20 years; was treasurer and deacon for ten years, and after he moved to
Columbia in 1865, was made deacon in the Baptist Church at that place, which was the first Baptist
Church west of the Alleghanies. He also took a lively interest and management in the erection of the
costly and elegant church building in Columbia in 1866-67. To this work he devoted of his means
lavishly, and its success as an organized society is due largely to his efficient and never-tiring labors.
Appreciating the advantages of an educated life, he gave his children a liberal education. Samuel was a
quiet, unassuming man, who cared little for office notoriety. In his township, for the sake of good
government and needed reforms, he held every office except that of clerk. He helped organize his
school district, and for 18 years following served as one of the trustees on the board of education. He
always believed in the power of the school to elevate society, and so he was a generous friend to
educational interests, all of his children, save one, enjoyed the advantages of collegiate studies at the
schools at Granville. He was a most faithful student of history, not only of our own but also of other
countries, and having enlarged his views by travel in this and foreign countries, he was a fund of
information that made him a most agreeable companion. Both were buried at Mt. Washington
Cemetery, Mt Washington, Hamilton, OH (Photos); and born to Samuel and Mary were:</div>
