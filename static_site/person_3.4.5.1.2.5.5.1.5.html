            <div class="person-text">(3.4.5.1.2.5.5.1.5) PLUMA VIVIAN FERRIS born May 25, 1889 on the farm east of Lorimor IA and
died 1959; buried Sunnyside Cemetery, Long Beach CA. She attended the local country school,
graduating from Lorimor High School 1906. She attended Capital City Commercial Colllege in Des
Moines IA and then worked in Des Moines several years. About 1910 she followed her brother Lorenzo
to Gooding ID and there married Patrick Moreland, the local agent for the Union Pacific Railroad. This
was his second marriage and he was at least 15 years older than her. Pat retired from the railroad during
the mid-1930s. Both of them had excellent business heads and as a result had a very comfortable
retirement. He died just before WWII, and immediately following the War, Pluma moved to Long
Beach CA where she remained until her death.</div>
