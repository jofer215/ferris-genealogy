            <div class="person-text">(1.10.2.9.2) VALENTINE MOTT, M.D., (Photograph) born August 20, 1785 Glen Cove,
Long Island, NY and died April 26, 1865 NYC
Dr. Valentine Mott was admittedly the most distinguished surgeon of his day. He was a native of
the State of New York, born at Glen Cove, Long Island, August 20, 1785, son of Dr. Henry Mott, a
physician of New York. He was of English ancestry and the American branch of his family was planted
on Long Island in 1660 by a Mott who was a Quaker. Valentine Mott was educated in a seminary at
Newtown, Long Island. He began his medical studies under Dr.
Valentine Seaman, a relative, and he afterwards attended the Medical School of Columbia College,
from which he was graduated in 1806, at the age of twenty-one. He then went to England and studied
under the eminent Sir Astley Cooper, in London, and had opportunity for hospital and dissecting room
observations in presence of others of the most capable practitioners of the day. These advantages were
supplemented by a course in the University of Edinburgh, Scotland.
In 1809 Dr. Mott entered upon practice in New York City, and his great abilities were soon
recognized and brought him high fame. Occupied with a large personal practice, he also turned his
attention to instructional work, which engaged his effort, with little interruption, throughout his life,
and for many years he was the most sought and highly regarded of all surgical instructors in the United
States. In 1810 he formed a private class in surgery, and the following year he was called to the
Professorship of Surgery in the Medical School of Columbia College. In 1813 he relinquished that
position, and with some of his Faculty associates became identified with the College of Physicians and
Surgeons. In that institution he was then, at the age of twenty-nine years, elected to the chair of
Principles and Practice of Surgery. In 1831, after a brief season in which he was disassociated from the
college, he returned to occupy a chair created for him, that of Operative Surgery and Surgical and
Pathological Anatomy, and, at the solicitation of the Faculty, he also taught clinical surgery in the New
York Hospital, with Dr. Alexander H. Stevens. Four years after his appointment, his close attention to
his profession had so worn upon his health that he went abroad for rest. His return was long delayed,
and in 1837 his chair was abolished. On his return, however, he was appointed Professor Emeritus, in
recognition of his great worth and highly useful
services. Besides the New York Hospital, Dr. Mott was connected with St. Vincent&#x27;s, St. Luke&#x27;s, the
Women&#x27;s, the Hebrew and Bellevue hospitals. He was connected with numerous professional bodies.
Besides serving as President of the New York Academy of Medicine and holding membership in

numerous American medical bodies, he was a fellow of the Medical and Chirurgical societies of
London and Brussels, of the Imperial Academy of Medicine, Paris, and the Paris Clinical Society, and
also of King&#x27;s and Queen&#x27;s College of Physicians of Ireland, the latter being a singularly exclusive
institution, having elected but about twenty honorary in the past two centuries. He was also invested
with the Turkish order of Medjidieh by the Sultan Abdul Medjid, as a reward for having removed a
tumor from the head of that monarch while on a visit to Constantinople. The University of Edinburgh
conferred upon him the honorary degree of Doctor of Medicine, and that of Doctor of Laws came from
the Regents of the University of the State of New York in 1851. In connection with his other duties he
was for many years President of the Medical Faculty of the University of the City of New York, and of
the New York Inebriate Asylum. Dr. Mott possessed the highest professional qualifications-undisturbable coolness and self-reliance, iron nerves, phenomenal muscular strength, and wonderfully
keen eyesight, and he was able to operate equally well with either hand. He was the pioneer in
numerous operations of extreme difficulty, which had hitherto been considered impossible, and he
frequently repeated such in cases where the after treatment was as important (and considered as
dangerous) as the operation. His ligature of the arteria innominata, in 1818, was declared to have made
&quot;an epoch in the life of the operata, and an era in the history of surgery.&quot; His reputation for originality
and skill was further enhanced by his splendid successes in the ligature of the primitive iliac, the
removal of the entire clavicle, and the resection of the inferior maxilla. During his professional career
he performed a prodigious amount of surgical work, his cases surpassing in number and gravity those
of any of his contemporaries, and his biographer declared that he performed &quot;a greater number of
important and capital operations than any surgeon who ever lived,&quot; and that &quot;for more than half a
century his reputation was unequalled by that of any of his competitors in America, and scarcely
surpassed by that of the most illustrious surgeons in Europe.&quot; His cases of limb amputations aggregated
the great number of nearly 1,000; he performed one hundred and sixty-five operations in lithotomy
with the loss of but one patient in twenty-seven, and his success in rhinoplastic operations was
unparalleled in the annals of American surgery. Until he was nearly eighty years of age, he retained
perfect control of his faculties and his accustomed skill in the performance of difficult operations. In
the year prior to his death, which occurred April 26, 1865, he was member of a commission of medical
experts sent to Annapolis, Maryland, by the national government, to examine into and report upon the
condition of federal soldiers just released from confederate prisons.
He was a teacher of rare excellence during a period of nearly a half century, and his pupils, in various
medical schools, were numbered by the thousand. He was not a theoretician, but taught facts, and, in
principal part, those of his own ascertainment or demonstration. His manner in the classroom was quiet
and dignified, and his voice was clear and distinct. His regard for the advancement of medical
knowledge is seen in his institution of three prize medals (in 1856) for the best dissections and clinical
reports in the University of the City of New York. He made by far the largest museum of anatomical
specimens, normal and morbid, ever gathered together in the country, representing the results of half a
century of careful personal work and collection, and of which a comprehensive illustrated catalogue
was made in 1858. It is pitiful to add that this magnificent museum was destroyed in 1866 by the
burning of the University Medical College.
He married in 1817, Louisa Dunmore Munn born November 20, 1796 Stanford, Lincolnshire, England
and died June 2, 1873; and born to them were:
