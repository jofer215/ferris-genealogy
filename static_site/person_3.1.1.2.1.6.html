            <div class="person-text">(3.1.1.2.1.6) BENSON FERRIS born March 21, 1794 Greenwich and died July 11, 1882 Tarrytown
NY; married January 23, 1822 Maria Acker born February 27, 1797 and died March 14, 1881; 1879 Mr.
Benson Ferris became president of the Tarrytown National Bank; ancestors of Mr. Ferris were an old
New England family who settled in Greenwich, Conn; his grandfather, Oliver Ferris, was an officer in
the Revolution, and served under General Montgomery in the invasion of Canada and was present in
1775, at the siege and capture of St. Johns. At the time he was quartermaster of his regiment, with the
rank of lieutenant, but was afterwards promoted to a captaincy. In the spring of 1802 Oliver Ferris
removed from Greenwich to Westchester County, and purchased from Major Jacob Van Tassel the farm
on the banks of the Hudson which, through the genius of Washington Irving, has become famous as
&quot;Wolfert&#x27;s Roost.&quot; Oliver Ferris married Abigail, daughter of Joha Lockwood, of Greenwich, Conn.
Their children were Elizabeth, wife of Aaron Close; Abigail, wife of Daniel Dutcher; Martha, wife of
John Jewell; Letty, wife of Daniel Ackerman; Sarah, wife of Smith Scofield; Benson; and Mary, wife of
Jacob Storms. Benson Ferris born March 21, 1794, and came with his father from his native town in
Connecticut. He early acquired the rudiments of a good English education, and was for some years
under the tuition of the Rev. Thomas Gibson Smith, pastor of the Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow.
Under him he commenced the study of Latin, in which he became proficient, and was especially fond

of Virgil, to whose writings he frequently referred. On January 23, 1822, he married Maria (February
27, 1797-March 14, 1881), daughter of Captain Abraham Acker (a lineal descendant of Wolfert Acker,
the founder of Wolfert&#x27;s Roost), and continued to live at the old homestead, &quot;Wolfert&#x27;s Roost,&quot; until
1835, when he sold the house and land adjoining to Washington Irving, who has given it an immortal
fame. See www.hvnet.com/houses/sunnyside/index.htm He then built a new house on the west side of
Broadway, a little north of Sunnyside Lane. In 1856 he sold this place and removed to Tarrytown,
where he died July 11, 1882. During his life he held nearly all the offices of the town of Greenburgh,
and was for twenty years a justice of the peace, and in this office used all the weight of his influence to
prevent rather than to promote litigation. He was a prominent member of the Old Dutch Church and of
the Second Reformed Church, in which he was an elder for many years. He was universally esteemed
in the community as a man of exemplary Christian life and distinguished usefulness. Mr. Ferris left
four children - William A., Benson, Jemima and Oliver. Of these children, Benson (3.1.1.2.1.6.2), the
second son, and the subject of this sketch, born at the old homestead, July 16, 1825. His early education was obtained at the old school-house, a relic of the olden time, which stood on the road running
east from Sunnyside Lane to the Saw-Mill River, about one hundred yards east of Broadway. He
afterwards attended the Tarrytown Institute, which was then under the able care of Professor William
G. Weston, A.M. After leaving this institution he was assistant for two years at the Paulding Institute,
of which Professor Weston was also principal, and was for some time teacher in the old school-house,
which he first attended. He then started a store at Irvington, which was the first one opened at that
place, then known as &quot;Dearman&quot;. In 1856 he removed to Tarrytown, which has since been his home,
and three years later become engaged in the hardware business, in which he continued till 1861. He
has been, during the whole of his business life, closely connected with the public affairs of the town
and county. While living at Irvington he was a member of the board of education, and has held the
same position at Tarrytown. In 1866 William H. Robertson, then county judge, appointed him school
commissioner for the second District of Westchester County. In 1879 he was elected a trustee of the
village of Tarrytown. In 1865 he was elected trustee of the Westchester County Savings-Bank, and has
held the offices of secretary, vice-president and president, in which last position he still remains. He
was one of the originators of the Tarrytown National Bank, and has been a director since its
organization. In 1855 he was one of sixteen who organized the Republican Party in Westchester
County, and was appointed, in 1858, one of the executive committee of the party, at a county
convention presided over by Horace Greeley, who was his friend and confidant. This position he held
for many years. Mr. Ferris married, in 1875, Mrs. Mary P. Dutcher, of Providence, R.I. In 1879 he was
elected a trustee of the village of Tarrytown. There are few men who have been more actively
employed in promoting the public and social interests of Tarrytown. He was one of the original
incorporators of the Young Men&#x27;s Lyceum, in 1869, and has served as one of its directors until the
present time. He became a director of the Tarrytown and Irvington Union Gas-Light Company in 1864,
and has been secretary, vice-president, and president. He is a member of the Westchester Historical
Society. In 1861 a committee was appointed by the citizens of Tarrytown to assist the families of
soldiers who had volunteered for the war. Of this committee Mr. Ferris was an active member, and
many thousands of dollars were raised and distributed under this direction and that of his associates.
Additional information on Sleepy Hollow and Wolfert&#x27;s Roost from the History of Westchester
County. Later on this seat of empire of the wizard sachem came into the possession of Wolfert Acker,

one of the privy counselors of Peter Stuyvesant. Afterwards it became the keep or stronghold of Jacob
Van Tassel, a valiant Dutchman of old stock of Van Tassels, who abound in Westchester County. It was
in his time, during the Revolutionary War, a rallying place for the patriots of Tarrytown, Petticoat Lane
and Sleepy Hollow, who formed a brotherhood for mutual defense and safety. Jacob was a leader in
all-daring enterprises, and, as Mr. Irving says, was ready to take a part in any scout or scrimmage by
land or water. The portentous bang of his great goose gun carried terror to the heart of the marauding
foe. Up to the time of the Revolution the place had formed a part of the old Manor of Philipsburgh,
and was occupied by Jacob Van Tassel as a tenant under his feudal lord, Frederick Philipse, but when
the latter went over to the King the land was forfeited to the State, and on December 6, 1785, the place
was conveyed to Jacob in fee-simple by the Commissioners of Forfeitures. The following is a copy of
the original deed, now the property of Benson Ferris, Esq., president of the Westchester County
Savings Bank:
