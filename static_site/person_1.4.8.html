            <div class="person-text">(1.4.8) MARY ANN FERRIS ‘Mercy’ died May 30, 1772 (Jim - usually when a second
child was named the same as an older child, it means the first one died at an early age,
so I am assuming the information I found is for this Mary and not 1.4.3, who I am
assuming died at an early age.); married Caleb Pell (1712-1768) who was the son of
Honorable Thomas Pell and Anna (by tradition), the daughter of an Indian sachem
