News: “September 24, 1915 NEAR DEATH IN AUTO ACCIDENT Bowman Citizen - Dr. and Mrs.
Mark Mizener of Bowman, narrowly escaped death or serious injury when their Ford runabout, which

the doctor was driving, hit a large rock, obscured by weeds in the center of a seldom traveled road,
while driving north of town Friday. The Doctor and Mrs. Mizener were out on a professional call and
were traveling on a cross trail about eight miles north of town, near the Claud Brooks&#x27; place. They were
traveling at about 25miles an hour when they hit the rock which stood squarely in the center of the trail
but which was obscured from view by the tall grass and weeds. Mrs. Mizener was thrown out of the
car, turning a complete somersault before hitting the ground. The doctor was thrown across the steering
wheel, landing with his nose across the top of the windshield. Jingo, the doctor&#x27;s fox terrier, was thrown
a distance of several yards. Mrs. Mizener was bruised and severely shaken up but fortunately no bones
were broken. The doctor will carry a remembrance of the accident for some time to come in the form of
a badly scratched and bruised nose. Jingo, it might be added, escaped without a scratch. The car did not
escape so fortunately as did its occupants. The force of the collision may be judged when it is learned
that the rock weighed several hundred pounds and was imbedded from eight to ten inches in the
ground. The car struck with such force that the rock was moved from its position although it was
imbedded firmly enough to stop the car within three feet. As far as the working parts of the car are
concerned it was practically a total wreck, everything from the radiator to the rear axle being broken or
twisted. &quot;Doc&quot; will buy a new car and is glad that it was only the Ford, which was severely
injured.” Born to them were:</div>
