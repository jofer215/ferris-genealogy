(1.1.3.1.1.3.1.1.2) JEAN PEARSALL born December 2, 1912 and died February 15,
2004; married Robert Nietzel Buck (Photo) born January 29, 1914 Elizabeth NJ; pilot
for TWA 1937-74; author of numerous books; see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Buck_(aviator); and born to them were:
February 19, 2004
Jean Pearsall Buck passed away peacefully on February 15, 2004 surrounded by family. She had recently moved to
Woodridge Nursing home in Berlin, Vermont after a two year battle with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. She was born in Westfield,
New Jersey on December 2, 1912. Her mother was Jessie Davidson Pearsall and her father, editor of The Standard
newspaper of Westfield, Ferris Randolph Pearsall. Jean Pearsall, a shy and glamorous young woman, was a model at both
Bonwit Teller and Bergdoff Goodman before her marriage to pilot Robert Buck. They wed on February 21, 1938, and she
became a world traveler. In an era when hardly anyone had been on an airplane, she joined him first in national and then
international travels. Paris was a favored destination. Her respectful attractive manner was befriending to all who met her.
Children especially were drawn to her gentle, kind words. She devoted her life to family and her passion for gardening and
conservation. Her seemingly innocent manner hid a tough woman who threw dirt, chucked rocks, sowed seeds, all in a
manner that would exhaust and pale a teenager. Her home was replete with stunning gardens and plants, the result of her
extensive self studies and observations from visits and investigations of many European and Eastern gardens during her
wide travels. In her youth she marched in the first NRA (National Recovery Act, a program of President Roosevelt) parade
in New York City, and on another occasion walked across the George Washington Bridge on its opening day. She is survived
by her husband, a daughter, Ferris Buck Urbanowski of N. Fayston, and son, Robert O. Buck, of Waterbury Center, as well
as three grandchildren and one great-granddaughter, five step-grandchildren and one step-great-grandson.Services are
private and will be held in the spring among the host of daffodils she planted around her home in North Fayston. In lieu of
flowers donations may be made to Mad River Valley Health Center Capital Campaign, P.O. Box 990, Waitsfield, Vermont
05673, or Central Vermont Home Health and Hospice, 600 Granger Road, Barre, VT 05641.</div>
