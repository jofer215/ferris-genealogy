            <div class="person-text">(1.2.5.1.14.4.2) ELLA UNDERHILL born April 17, 1837 Ossining NY and died August
31, 1881; married 1856 Thomas LeVan Smull (1835-1892); is this the same Thomas L
Smull?
Smull&#x27;s Tannery.-For many years one of the loading industries of the county, because of the inexhaustible supply of
hemlock, has been tanning, and every year the industry still grows. While this factory is not in the corporate limits of the
borough, yet being on the opposite bank of the Chemung river, it may well be rated a part of the common town industrial
plants. This was commenced in 1870 by Underhill &amp; Maurice, who operated it about one year, and Charles E. Maurice
became sole owner, and then it passed to Underhill &amp; Noble, and in 1876 Thomas L. Smull purchased the plant, and has
operated it since. The annual output is 1,250,000 pounds of leather, principally shipped to the English market; the raw hides

are purchased and shipped from all parts of the Western World. The covering is 750 feet long, and is filled with the best
machinery and appliances for carrying on the work. About fifty men are employed. (Athens Township, Bradford Co PA)
