            <div class="person-text">(3.10.7.2.7.3.1.5.1.3) WILIAM TALIAFERRO CLOSE, M.D., (Photo) born in CT; operated a clinic in
the Belgian Congo 16y; plenty of info on the ‘Net; married Bettine Moore.
William T. Close, M.D. was born in Connecticut, attending school and living in the United States, England and France.
Early experiences at the American Hospital in Paris, where his father was the managing governor, stimulated his interest in
medicine and the work of doctors, especially the mysterious and prestigious world of the surgeon. His schoolteachers
described him as having &quot;singleness of purpose&quot; and &quot;boundless enthusiasm,&quot; attributes that are associated with individuals
in precise and demanding occupations, such as pilots and surgeons. However, this is only part of the beginnings of a life
dedicated to the care of others. Another, more complex piece, comes from an early commitment to service to others, a
binding theme that defines, in part, the lives and wonderful marriage of Bill and his wife Tine. This commitment to service
has sustained them through separations during war, medical training, and later during the dangerous periods in Africa. The
Closes were a traditional American family of the 1950&#x27;s, with Tine raising the children while Bill trained in medicine. In
looking back at time lost with the children and Tine, Bill expresses regrets, revealing an ability and willingness to honestly
self-analyze one&#x27;s decisions over time at a level that is rare, that few people have the integrity and courage to attempt.
Commitment to service, combined with a drive to meet challenges and seek adventure, led Bill to accept an assignment to
the Belgian Congo in 1960. What began as a religious mission placed Bill in a dynamic and dangerous political situation
that eventually exploded into war, with the critical medical needs of the people in crisis steering him once again into his
destiny as a surgeon and physician. Close was quickly immersed into long days and nights of surgery and medical care in
the capital of the conflicted country, Kinshasa. Over time he became the head of a large hospital, the personal physician to
President Mobutu, and the chief medical officer of the Congolese army. Upon returning to the United States in 1976, the
Close&#x27;s chose the mountains of Wyoming to settle in and begin new lives away from the intense life in Africa. Seeking a
slower, quieter time, they bought a ranch near Big Piney, Wyoming. Within a short period of time Bill is once again drawn
to the needs of the local people, and begins providing primary medical care in this isolated part of Wyoming, eventually
building a practice of over 3,000 patients. It is during this time he also provides the opportunity for many medical students
and residents to visit him and work with him in his rural practice. He builds friendships with faculty and students of medical
schools, and becomes a sought after teacher and mentor.
In recent years Dr. Close has been the commencement speaker at several medical schools in the United States and
has given speeches at multiple national medical meetings. He was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters by
the University of Utah in 2001, and delivered the commencement speech to the entire graduating body the same day.

Booksandauthors.net: Where did you grow up and was reading and writing a part of your life? Who were your earliest
influences and why?

William T. Close, M.D: I grew up in France where my father was the managing governor of the American Hospital in Paris.
I went to school in England. The family moved back to the United States at the onset of the Second World War. I attended
St. Paul&#x27;s School in New Hampshire followed by Harvard pre-med, then married and into the Air Corps. My earliest
influences were my parents, particularly my father and his head nurse at the hospital in Paris who took me with her on
rounds and encouraged me to become a surgeon. I was seven and eight at the time. Other early influences were the teachers
involved in an English schooling who stressed &quot;For God and Country my boy,&quot; and, &quot;Better to have tried and failed than
never to have tried at all.&quot; My mother and some teachers read us the classics and favorites of the time like P.G. Wodehouse&#x27;s
characters Jeeves and Bertie Wooster, Ivanhoe, Kipling&#x27;s Jungle Stories, Treasure Island and some Dickens were also
favorites. At St. Paul&#x27;s my biology teacher lent me a glossy-paged, great-smelling pathology book and asked me to write a
paper on stomach cancer. The work confirmed my love of medicine, specifically surgery. Writing would come much much
later.
Booksandauthors.net: Your book EBOLA THROUGH THE EYES OF THE PEOPLE was Foreword Magazine&#x27;s Book of
the Year Award Winner -- Talk a little about the state of Africa&#x27;s healthcare - Then, Now and The Future. Please explain here
what Ebola is and how devastating it can be to a civilization.
William T. Close, M.D: Health care in Africa obviously varies from major region to major region. In Central Sub-Sahara
Africa, the major problems are abject poverty and HIV/AIDS that is infecting and killing millions of people. The Epilogue
in Ebola: Through the Eyes of the People offers some perspective. Epilogue: In the spring of 2001, some months before the
publication of this new edition of Ebola, a small gathering of friends met for lunch in Banneux, a holy place in Belgium. A
peaceful sanctuary to The Virgin of the Poor stands in sharp contrast to the monuments to the allied troops who defeated
Hitler&#x27;s last offensive in the Ardennes in the Battle of the Bulge fought over Christmas and New Year of 1944-45. The
friends around the table in the small, gracious Eau Vive restaurant were Sister Veronica, Dr. Collard, Dr. Miatamba and Dr.
William Close, the author of this book. Sister Veronica&#x27;s real name is Sister Genoveva. She and her sister Gabrielle, also a
nun, are the &quot;mothers&quot; to young missionaries from around the world who learn French in &quot;The House of Languages&quot;
in Banneux. Geno did in fact return to Yambuku after her escape to Belgium in 1976. Her rice cooperative had been taken
over by a Congolese. Over the next few years the mission at Yambuku was turned over to Congolese Sisters and in 1990
Geno built and taught in a private school in Binga in Equateur province, a long, rugged drive from Yambuku when the roads
were passable. In June 1999, the province was held by forces in rebellion against the central government. During a visit to
Binga by the rebels, Belgian TV journalists filmed Geno with their leader. Belgian government authorities, fearing a hostile
reaction from the Congolese president, ordered the sisters out of the country. Geno continues to do what she can for her
Congolese counterparts in Yambuku and Binga. Dr. Collard&#x27;s real name is Dr. Jean-François Ruppol. He was indeed born in
the Congo and at the time of the first epidemic was an early key player in bringing relief and imposing quarantines in the
Bumba/Yambuku areas. Over the past twenty-five years he has been the moving force in the Belgium and Congo based
Fonds Médical Tropical (Tropical Medical Foundation). The foundation&#x27;s main work has focused on the support of health
district hospitals and the fight against the growing pandemic of sleeping sickness. At this writing, FOMETRO has been
given the job of managing funds from the World Bank for the control and prevention of HIV/AIDS in the Congo. Thus Dr.
Ruppol&#x27;s responsibilities continue to grow. He remains deeply committed to the people of the Congo. Dr. Miatamba&#x27;s real
name is Dr. Malonga Miatudila. He is a public health specialist in World Bank based in Washington. Following his role in
the 1976 Ebola epidemic he became Community Health director then director of the two-thousand bed general hospital in
Kinshasa. He served as medical advisor to the ministry of health. He has been with the World Bank since 1989 and
commutes regularly to the countries of central Africa and occasionally to Wyoming for a breath of fresh air. Ebola fever is
an African hemorrhagic fever whose source remains unknown. The incubation period is a week or ten days and over the
next week or so those killed by the virus develop high fever, nausea and vomiting, dehydration, and bleeding, usually
oozing rather than acute hemorrhage from the mouth, eyes, intestines and skin. Scientists at Atlanta&#x27;s Centers for Disease
Control identified and named the new virus, Ebola, after a river in the region. The epidemic was controlled by the traditional
isolation of villages imposed by local chiefs. Three hundred eighteen cases and 280 deaths (88% case fatality) were
documented over a two month period. A small outbreak occurred in the Sudan in 1979. &quot;During 1994-1996, no less than
five independent active sites of Ebola virus transmission were identified.&quot; Some of these were new strains. In 1995, Ebola
surfaced again in the Congo, in Kikwit, a city of some 200,000 people, 500 km east of Kinshasa, the capital of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). . . . &quot;As in the rest of DRC, a declining public sector has recently had
devastating effects on the communities health care, education, transportation and communication facilities. [Surveillance]
was hindered by many logistic difficulties, including the lack of transportation and telephones. It was also hampered by

confounding societal forces that led to concealment and denial of cases to avoid the social stigmata that rapidly became
attached to those with the disease.&quot; A total of 315 cases were recorded with a mortality that varied as the epidemic
progressed from 100% to 69%. The most recent Ebola outbreak occurred in Uganda between August 2000 and January
2001. The strain was Ebola-Sudan. Once more, the outbreak started in a hospital, this time in the northeastern region&#x27;s
hospital in Gulu. A total of 425 presumptive cases were recorded from three districts with 224 deaths (Case-fatality rate =
53%). Ebola hemorrhagic fever comes and goes killing three to four hundred people at a time before disappearing into a
hiding place as yet to be discovered. Ebola is dramatic but is nothing compared to HIV/AIDS (17 million Africans have died
of AIDS since the late 1970s). Added to HIV&#x27;s death march across the continent are the old killers: measles, drug resistant
tuberculosis, sleeping sickness, dysentery, cholera, malnutrition and violence of man against man and men against women
and children. The common ground for all these diseases is poverty, abject poverty and the breakdown of basic government
services. Adolo, a female nurse trained by Sister Lucie, buried her friend Adika a male nurse also trained by Sister Lucie
who died from Ebola. Adolo survived the Ebola epidemic only to become infected with HIV. &quot;Why? Why did that happen?&quot;
I asked Sister Geno. The answer was simple and fundamental to the spread of the disease: Adolo was a nurse, a good one,
but hadn&#x27;t been paid in three years. She had three children to feed so she rented her body for money. Her attitude when she
learned of her fate: &quot;I don&#x27;t worry. A lot of other things could kill me before HIV.&quot; Unless poverty is tackled with a
vengeance particularly through the empowerment of women, no amount of talk or money for programs dealing with
HIV/AIDS will be effective.
Booksandauthors.net: Who are the Sisters of Sacred Heart of Mary?
William T. Close, M.D: The Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Mary are an order of teaching sisters and some nursing sisters in
Gravenwezel near Antwerp. Sister Veronica, a protagonist in the book is from this community.
Booksandauthors.net: A DOCTOR&#x27;S LIFE is a collection of unique stories that everyone will enjoy reading - Do you have a
favorite story in this collection? Is there a story that did not make it in the collection?
William T. Close, M.D: Patrice and the Chimp is one of my favorites; John is another. There are as yet untold stories in a
new manuscript called &quot;A Dictator&#x27;s Doctor: Unplanned Adventures in the Congo,&quot; which is progressing through the long
and tortuous birth canal of publishing.
Booksandauthors.net: SUBVERSION OF TRUST is a work of fiction and a winner of the Benjamin Franklin Award from
the PMA - After authoring works of nonfiction how did you switch gears for this novel of fiction? Talk a little about your
fictional character Alex McKinnon and how much of the author is represented with this character?
William T. Close, M.D: Subversion of Trust is based on reality. Parts of it are certainly autobiographical and most of the
patients in the book could be associated with people I have cared for over the years. Jenny Morgan is a composite of several
young women doctors who combine medical competence and the sort of care more particularly present in many professional
women. As far as switching gears is concerned, it would be hard to define. In fact, Ebola and Subversion of Trust are far
more fact than fiction, but because they fall under the category of fiction or historical fiction the author is allowed to use
dialogue, descriptions, combine characters, compress time to give color and understanding to the reality of the stories and
events. Having lived and worked in the Congo for sixteen years and having been in medical practice for over 50 years, the
parts of the stories that are fictional derive from long experience. I believe they pass the test of verisimilitude.
Booksandauthors.net: In your commencement speeches what is it you want graduates to know and take with them in their
journey? Was there someone special that spoke at one of your graduations/commencements that has stayed with you
through the years?
William T. Close, M.D: The main effect of most other graduation speeches that I have heard is that they have been too
long. I hope that those who have heard my graduation speeches will take to heart the lessons that patients have taught me: A
few springs ago, on a walk with my dogs through the willows and pastures adjacent to our home, I recalled some of the
prescriptions I received from my patients over the years. Their charge, which I pass on to you, rode in on the calls of
Sandhill cranes as my shaggy friends and I rossed a little stream swollen with the early melt of mountain snow. I heard a
patient say, &quot;Define quality of life and quality of care only after you are sure what I, the patient, mean by quality. My
definition will depend upon my age, my life style, my beliefs, but some factors about quality care are true for all of us. We
patients would express these truths to all of you in the healing professions as follows: &quot;Help me to learn ways of living and
working and loving which will keep me as healthy and happy as possible. &quot;If I do become ill or disabled, undertake only
treatments which will relieve my suffering and improve the quality of living for me and those close to me. Encourage me to
help myself to the maximum so that my dignity as a human being remains intact. If I am down-and-out, without support of
family or friends, please do not desert me. Another patient said, &quot;Give me your advice based on your careful judgment of

what is best for me. Help me to understand the reasons for your advice, then give me the freedom to choose my own way
and support it to the best of your ability. While I live, give me your heart as well as your mind, your time as well as your
pills and needles. Give me your promise that, when my time comes to die, I will not need to fear big pain, or loss of control,
or loss of dignity. &quot;I, your patient, need to trust you as my partner in care. I expect you to know as much as you can about
the scientific advances in your profession. I also expect you to remember, even when you&#x27;re tired and stressed-out, that I
need to be treated as a human being with my own fears and feelings and hopes. I, your patient, have the highest expectations
of you as my counselor, and sometimes as my healer.&quot; Keeping such a compact with patients in today&#x27;s hard-sell,
competitive arena of profit-oriented medicine may be one of the greatest adventures and challenges our profession has ever
faced. We must persevere in our advocacy for patients and earn the right to their trust.
Booksandauthors.net: What do you hope to achieve with your books? What do you hope readers will take away after
reading your books?
William T. Close, M.D: I hope that the books will show readers that doctors and nurses who make every effort to combine
scientific medical excellence with humane care of the individual have not all been swallowed and regurgitated by the
medical and insurance industries. I hope the books will inject fresh courage in doctors to give patients the time they need to
be heard and provide some hope to patients that physicians can be friends as well as technicians.
Booksandauthors.net: What has been your feedback from readers?
William T. Close, M.D: The feedback from readers has been very positive. All of the books have been read by a large
variety of people, and have often been purchased as Christmas presents. Ebola has sold over 250,000 in both editions and
continues to develop an audience. Subversion of Trust is on the way to becoming an ABC TV movie and A Doctor&#x27;s Life has
been read by students and teachers of medicine in many of our best schools.
Booksandauthors.net: What&#x27;s next?
William T. Close, M.D: A Dictator&#x27;s Doctor: Unplanned Adventures in the Congo. The manuscript details my sixteen years
in the Congo/Zaire as Chief Doctor for the Congolese Army, President Mobutu&#x27;s personal physician, my medical practice,
the rebuilding and staffing of the 2,000-bed general hospital in the capital city of Kinshasa. The book is written from the
particular point of view of a physician and surgeon involved in the chaos called Congo and the very hot Cold War in Central
Africa. I hope that the reader will come away with an impression that our American view that individuals can be neatly
divided into white hats and black hats is a handicap to our understanding of different cultures and the crying needs of
populations in the so-called underdeveloped world.
Booksandauthors.net: What was the last book you read?
William T. Close, M.D: Voyage Au Congo by André Gide and on to Volume 18 of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s saga about Captain Aubrey and
Dr. Maturin.
Booksandauthors.net: Do you have any hobbies? What are they? How do they enhance your writing?
William T. Close, M.D: Classical music, particularly Dvorak, Beethoven, Sibelius, Berlioz, Verdi, Puccini et al. Fly fishing,
cross-country skiing and walking my two greyhounds, Dulcinea and Desperado, and my new small, white, fluffy mutt
puppy, Max. These hobbies are fun and encourage reflection.
