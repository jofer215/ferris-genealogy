            <div class="person-text">(2.6.7.3.5.2.5) ANDREW LEE ALLEN Jr (Polymagist) born August 16, 1832 Burton, Cattaraugus, NY
and died June 8, 1918 Richmond, Cache, UT; buried there; married 1st March 4, 1872 in SLC UT
Minerva Whittle born May 15, 1854 Harriman, Salt Lake, UT and died September 18, 1929 Cove UT;
buried Richmond UT; and 2d May 8, 1884 in Logan, Cache, UT (Annie) Ann Spackman born
November 8, 1868 West Woody, Wiltshire, England;
After his parents joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, he went with them on their journey Westward.
While living at the junction of the Missouri and Platte Rivers he worked in his brother, Elijah&#x27;s sawmill. The money earned
operating this mill and the sale money of it helped provide the family with the means to outfit them for their trip across the
plains. He and 1his brothers were united workers, which brought success to their many financial projects. Andrew, James,
and Charles were among the group who continued to San Bernardino, California to pioneer. After being there two years they
had the opportunity to haul some freight to Salt Lake City. Their mother, sister and younger brothers for the return trip to
California joined them. They lived a good life in California until their Mother desired to see her children in Utah before she
died. After returning to Richmond, Utah, Andrew Lee and his brothers owned and operated a sawmill. He served in the
Black hawk War. With Seul Lamb of Hyde Park, Utah he stood guard against the Indians. They took turns shoveling snow
so each could get a catnap on the well-frozen ground. He married Minerva Whittle, daughter of Thomas Levi and Mary Jane
Butterfield Whittle, 4 Mar 1872 in Salt Lake City, Utah. He filed on 160 acres of land In Coveville, Utah where they made
their new home 1873. His brother Levi lived with them nearly i6 years until he married in 1888. Levi was loved and
respected by all the family. It was here that most of Andrew and Minerva&#x27;s children were born. Andrew and Levi acquired a
large tract of land by homesteading and buying. They farmed the land as one large farm for many years and never had
trouble. There was a sincere love and respect between them, which was very rare. On the farm they raised hay, grain, beef
and dairy cattle. When they dissolved the partnership, one teenage boy from each family was sent to divide the cattle and
every one concerned was satisfied with their division. They gave 40 acres of land to the Coveville Ward for the Missionary
Farm and it is now used as the Ward Welfare Farm. After he was ordained a High Priest 27 Nov 1882 by M. W. Merrill, he
was set apart as counselor to Bishop John C. Larsen who was the first Bishop of Coveville Ward. He served faithfully and
efficiently for more than 25 years, He married Ann Spackman 8 May 1884. She was the daughter of Edward and Rosanna
Black Spackman. Andrew and Ann were the parents of four daughters. He took his second wife to Canada with the original
Pioneer Company that left northern Utah the latter part of March 1887. His first- wife, Minerva, remained with the older
family on the home farm in Cove. He drove his team and plow that plow e d the first furrow for the city of Cardston with
President Card holding the plow. He and his nephew, Warner Allen, proceeded to break one half acre on Lees Creek bottom
which they planted with vegetables. He returned to Utah In October 1887 and his homecoming was sad as his second son,
Sidney had died. He arrived just before the funeral. He took every opportunity to better the community and state by helping
with the building of schools, churches, temples, factories, and piping of spring water for home and community use. He also
aided in supplying electric lights and he provided all his family and others to get an education. He had a strong faith that
things that seemed impossible to do could be done. He proved that faith by saving a pair of badly frozen hands after the
doctors said they must be cut off to save the life of the individual. Through faith not a finger was lost. He had vision to
acquire enough land to provide work for all his family. He was honest and upright in all things and was loved and respected
by all who knew him.
