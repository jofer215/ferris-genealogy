            <div class="person-text">(1.1.4.3.5.4.8.1.1.2) ALBERT LUKE IRELAND (Allie) or (Irish Al) born February 25,
1918 and died c1995 (From the Putnam County News and Recorder, November 10,
2004: On Saturday, November 13, 2004 at 11 am at the Cold Spring Cemetery, the remains of Albert Ireland will be laid
to rest in the family plat with a full military service. Staff Sergeant Ireland served honorably in the United States Marine
Corp in the Pacific Theater during World War II and in the Korean conflict. He received nine Purple Hearts along with other
citations during his tours of duty. This would appear to be the same Albert, so the death date of

c1995 is apparently wrong. He was quite an athlete and a ‘Real Marine’, who learned to
box from an uncle on his mother’s side named Jack Phelan, who was a former
middleweight champ of the Irish Connaught Rangers. He began to take boxing seriously
when a carnival came to Cold Spring in 1939 andhe challenged a boxer who outweighed
him by 35 pounds. He received the decision but tired and lost the third round. He
continued to box throughout his military career. Boxing was part of his life. For some
unknown reason, he even wanted to fight Edward Charles Skitt at the wedding of his
daughter, Jeanann and her new husband, Robert Ireland. Before all that, in 1941, he
hitch-hiked to Canada to join the Royal Canadian Air Force. Five days after the attack
on Pearl Harbor, he transferred to the US Marines. He enlisted at the age of 23 in New
York City and was sent to boot camp in San Diego. He served on Guadalcanal with
Company M.., 3d Battalion, 6th Marines, 2d Division, where he was hit with shrapnel
which lodged in his lung. He then contacted malaria and ended up in a hospital in New
Zealand. For this, he received his first Purple Heart and a Letter of Commendation for
gallantry in action. While in New Zealand, he was Regimental Champ Boxer. From New
Zealand, he went to Balboa Hospital in San Diego for further treatment. Next stop was
Camp Pendleton where he trained with a Raider Battalion, then went back to
Guadalcanal with the 62d Rep. Battalion, 1944. On Guadalcanal, he and 6 buddies
stowed aboard ship to go to Okinawa with Company A., 1st Battalion, 4th Marines, 6th
Division and went in with the assault waves. Here, he received 4 Purple Hearts; one on
April 16, one on May 22, again in early June. From there he went to Guam until the end

of the war. He went back to Japan for the MacArthur surrender acceptance. He was
discharged December 12, 1945, Bainbridge MD. He then spent one year at Ithaca
College and then one year at the U of Arizona. In 1950, he was at Notre Dame when the
Korean War broke out. After being turned down four times, he was finally accepted for
reenlistment in New York City and went to Camp LeJeune where he retrained with the
6th Marines, 2d Division. He was told he could not go back into combat because of a
rule that men with two Purple Hearts could not go into combat. He finally talked a
Colonel into intereceding with Commandant Cates for him. Commandant Cates granted
permission and he was flown to Guam, Japan, and then Korea for 14 months where he
was wounded with shrapnel four more times. He later received an honorable discharge.
In all, he received nine Purple Hearts, two Bronze Stars, twelve personal citations and
the informal title of The Fighting Marine. After discharge, he studied at Notre Dame
(listed as a Lost Member of the Notre Dame Class of 1954) and then Ithaca College
where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science Degree. He taught history and health
education for many years at New York City High School.</div>
