            <div class="person-text">(3.1.9.1.9.9.9) CHARLES ALBERT FERRIS (Photo) born August 20, 1852 and died November 5,
1935 at the Soldier’s Home, Washington DC.; married 1st Ada Cornelia Davey (Wall) and 2d Florida
Thompson. From an obituary, Forsyth, Rosebud County, Montana, July 5, 1924: It was a shock to the
people of Forsyth and vicinity to learn last Friday morning of the death of Mrs. Charles A. Ferris, at the
ranch home on lower Armells valley. Following an operation at the Miles City hospital, two months
ago she was removed to her home and her condition was thought to be improving, but a turn for the
worse was taken and her death came as a surprise. She suffered from cancer of the stomach for nearly
five years, but was never considered serious until last fall, preceding the operation. All that could be
done, was done, promptly, and cheerfully, but to no avail, and the end came peacefully, ending many
days of agony for her and mental suffering for her family and friends. Ada Davey born May 6, 1861,
near Utica NY and grew to young womanhood at that place. She was united in marriage to Charles
Ferris December 27, 1894 and they lived on the ranch, when death overcame her Friday, May 30, 1924
at age 63 years and 24 days. She was a good woman and her loss is reflected through the entire
community. Many are those who loved her - deeply and sincerely - and her passing will be keenly felt.
To her grief-stricken family, her vacant chair can never be occupied. Miss Davey was the daughter of a
civil war veteran and married a veteran of the Indian wars, as Mr. Ferris came west nearly 60 year ago,
and saw considerable army service on the frontier. Besides her husband, Mrs. Ferris is survived by
three children: Mary - Mrs. Raymond Williams, of Elk, Washington; Kenneth and Alice at home.
Interment was made in the Forsyth cemetery (Photo);
