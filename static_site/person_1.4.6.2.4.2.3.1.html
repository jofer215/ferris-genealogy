            <div class="person-text">(1.4.6.2.4.2.3.1) MAY DOHERTY born March 12, 1896 in what is now Throggs Neck
NY and died July 9, 1998, Lakewood NJ; buried in the cemetery of St. Peters Episcopal
Church, only a short distance from the school house she attended as a child. She was laid
to rest in a family plot that dates back to the Civil War. May attended school in a small
red school house in Westchester Square. Upon completing her education, May joined
with her sisters working as a school teacher in the Bronx. She is remembered as a
wonderful woman who touched the lives of many through her work and preservation of
the history of the Bronx. In 1955, May joined with John McNamara as founding
members of the Bronx Historical Society. May remained in the Bronx until 1978, when
she moved to New Jersey. When May left the Bronx she donated a treasure of family
artifacts, such as ledgers, books and pictures that trace the history of the Bronx back to
the Civil War. She never married.</div>
