            <div class="person-text">(3.10.1.2.1.9.4.5.1.11) AMY LUCILLE DARBY born February 9, 1911 Clarksville IA; married
December 8, 1932 in Rockford IL, Arthur Wilford Froberg; “Aunt Lucille sent information on her kids,
grandchildren &amp; great grandchildren. Uncle Art has Parkinson&#x27;s, and he is 94 years old this year! Aunt
Lucille is 89 this year &amp; she is still going strong! She has had diabetes for a number of years. Uncle Art
&amp; Aunt Lucille are still living in their home on &quot;Sandy Hollow&quot; Road, in Rockford. They have it all
painted up &amp; all cleaned up so nice, they love it there! Their daughter, Gloria built a house just next
door to them, only about sixteen feet away, Aunt Lucille says! Aunt Lucille and Uncle Art had several
acres when they first got that property. Aunt Lucille says they were &quot;out in the boondocks&quot; back then,
but it&#x27;s all the city of Rockford around them now. They are still on their own septic tank and have their
own well. Their son Kent lives in Wisconsin near to Minneapolis, MN, so he is a little ways away.”</div>
