            <div class="person-text">(5.1.3.2.4.2) SAMUEL FERRIS, M. D., (S.A.R. #1733) born March 13, 1822 and died November 4,
1901 New Castle IN; married March 14, 1845 Margaret Lohr [Chaplain Ferris has Samuel marrying
Margaret C. St. John, M. D.];
Hazzard’s History of Henry County 1822-1906: Biographical Sketch of Samuel Ferris, M.D., Eminent Physician and
Surgeon and Leading Citizen of New Castle.
No one, except an immediate member of a family, has so intimate a knowledge of the inner life of its circle as
the attending physician. He is not merely a dispenser of medicines for the cure or alleviations of physical ills; he must also
be a healer of minds distressed. How high, indeed, must the standard of honor be among the members of a profession whose
duty it is to invade the secret recesses of the mind and heart? Subject only to the judgment of conscience, how constantly
must the physician be on his guard to keep inviolate the confidence of his patients. So seldom, too, is this trust and
confidence violated that it is a crown of honor to the whole profession. Then, too, see how wonderfully the smiling lip and
the kindly word of the true physician quiet the fears of the sick and inspire them with hope, while the scowling countenance
and surly demeanor of another counteract the utmost efforts of his skill in the medical art. Every student of this most ancient
and honorable profession must be governed by the most exacting rules of ethics illustrated by the unselfish and single
minded devotion to duty which has characterized the lives of its eminent practitioners, and by as much as he fails to attain
this ideal standard he falls short of being the perfect healer.
Dr. Samuel Ferris possesses those qualities of mind and heart which are so essential to the successful physician
and which for the want of a closer analysis are popularly said to make of one a “natural physician”. He was an educated
gentleman and supplemented his natural abilities by thorough and exhaustive investigation, and during a practice of many
years’ duration he was constantly alert to the advances being made in medicine and surgery.
He was the lineal descendant, according to the genealogical records of the family, of Jeffrey Ferris, the first of
the American family of that name. He is said to have been a native of Leicester, England, who came to America in 1635 and
settled in Boston, Mass (incorrect). He died in 1666. His descendants in order were as follows: James (the first) who died
about 1726; Samuel Ferris (the first), born in September, 1706 and died in 1786; Samuel Ferris (the second), born in
February, 1733 and was a soldier of the Revolution; Frederick Ferris, the father of Samuel Ferris (the third), subject of this
sketch; he was a native of Connecticut, where he married Susannah Nichols. He was born in 1784 and died in 1845; his wife
was born in 1791 and died in 1832. They moved from Connecticut in 1813 and settled on a farm, four miles northwest of
Brookville, Franklin County, Indiana.
Frederick and Susannah (Nichols) Ferris were the parents of twelve children, namely: William K., Ann D.,
Susan E., John W., Caroline, Catherine, James S., Mary, Samuel, Allison B., Isaiah, and a daughter who died in infancy. Of

these children, the first five were born in Connecticut and the remainder in Indiana. All of this family is now dead.
Catharine became the wife of the late James M Clements, who was for several years surveyor of Henry County and who
was also the father of Courtland C. Clements, of Washington City. Mrs. Clements was an excellent woman and mother and
much beloved of a large circle of relatives and friends. James S. Ferris, the third son, was for several years a teacher in New
Castle; he was the first county school examiner and was for eight years, 1856-63, auditor of Henry County. He died
September 23, 1870.
Samuel Ferris, the fourth son of Frederick and Susannah (Nichols) Ferris, was born the farm in Franklin County,
Indiana March 13, 1822. He remained under the parental roof until he was about eighteen years of age, when in 1840 he
became a medical student under the then well known physician, Dr. Ziba Casterline, of Liberty, Union County, Indiana. He
remained with Dr. Casterline as student and assistant for two or three more years and then located at Cadiz, Henry County,
Indiana where he practiced for about six months. He then entered into partnership with his former preceptor, Dr Casterline,
at Liberty. This partnership continued for about two years, after which he located at New Paris, Ohio, where he remained for
twelve years. In 1865 he removed to New Castle, Henry County, Indiana, and there continued in the practice of his
profession until his retirement in 1898. He died November 4, 1901.
Dr. Samuel Ferris was a man of positive opinions and firm in the discharge of his duties. He was a law-abiding
citizen and believed in the strict and impartial enforcement of the law, whether for the prevention of crime, the preservation
of health or the elevation of the morals of the community. He was a man of the strictest integrity and demanded like
conformity by others in the highest standard of living. He took especial pride in the profession which he adorned and its
numerous and onerous demands were met by him with alacrity until worn out in well doing and borne down by the weight
of years he was compelled to relinquish to other hands the work he had so long and so faithfully performed. He was a
successful physician with a large practice throughout his career and was esteemed by the laity as well as the profession of
his learning and ability. In his profession he was zealous and untiring and endeared himself to the afflicted by his cheerful
sympathy and ready aid. He carried rays of sunshine into hundreds of households and departing left behind him an
atmosphere charged with confidence and hope. Among his family and friends he was a social and companionable man and
he was never more delightful than when ministering to their content and happiness.
In addition to his constant practice of medicine, Dr. Ferris was for a number of years health officer of the
Corporation of New Castle and during his term in office performed his duties most satisfactorily. He firmly believed that
cleanliness is next to godliness. He made frequent personal investigations and enforced observance of his orders by appeal
to the law when his instructions were disobeyed or ignored.
Dr. Samuel Ferris, it will be noted, practiced his profession in New Castle and contiguous places for more than
forty five years. During this time, he was a delegate to the American Medical Association, at Chicago 1in 1863, from the
Henry County Medical Society, which had helped to organize in 1856, and which was the first society of its kinds in the
county. He was for many years a member of the State Medical Society of Indiana. In 1882 he was a member of the Board of
Trustees of New Castle and in the same year became by appointment one of the board of examining surgeons for pensions
which position he filled acceptably for several years. He was the friend of the soldier and while faithfully performing his
duty as a member of the board, he always decided doubtfully points in favor of the defender of his country.
At New Paris, Preble County, Ohio, March 13, 1845, Dr. Samuel Ferris married Margaret C., daughter of John
and Sarah Lohr, of that place. This was a happy union and together they lived in perfect harmony and love for more than
fifth six years. She still survives him and though advanced in years, having been born April 17, 1824, she finds consolation
in the earnest filial love and devotion of his children. Dr. Samuel and Margaret (Lohr) Ferris were the parents of nine
children, of whom but four are now living, namely: William E., Eliza M., now Mrs. James A Martindale, of New Castle;
Luella and Edgar S. William E Ferris is a practical farmer and gardener, residing two miles north of New Castle, where he
gives great attention to the cultivation of the strawberry and other popular fruits. He is an industrious and intelligent worker
and his efforts have met with deserved success. Luella lives at home with her mother and manages the household. A sketch
of Dr. Edgar S. Ferris follows.
Dr. Samuel Ferris and his wife were lifelong members of the Methodist Episcopal Church. During his life they
were punctual attendants upon its services and liberal contributors to its support. Since his death, Mrs. Ferris continues her
devotion to the same denomination. Dr. Ferris was not a member of any secret organization, although he had at times
expressed a preference for the Masonic order with which his son, Dr. Edgar S. Ferris, is prominently identified.
