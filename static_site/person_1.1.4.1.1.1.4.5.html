Dear Mother,
I am not at work this afternoon so I thought the very best thing I could do was to write home. I suppose you have heard
before this that I still have the old gold fever and had started again for the north. I left home the eighth of Jan. and set sail
from Seattle on the Cottage City the (illegible) was an ocean trip never to be forgotten. The first 4 days out the weather was
very fine. On the fifth day, we came across a passenger boat called the City of Seattle. She was on her return trip from
Alaska with about 100 people aboard and in a gale had lost her propellar and had been drifting for 14 hours. When one
came across her she lay within 20 ft. of a reef of rocks and still drifting in a very heavy sea. Our boat tried six times before
they could get a rope fastened to her then we towed her back to Juneau. We lay in that port till the next day and started again
for the north. About 2 PM we struck one of the most terrific storms I have ever experienced anywhere. The wind was
accompanied by snow which was so thick that we couldn&#x27;t see 4 feet from the boat. The captain lost his bearings so we
turned around and drifted with the wind for an hour then turned again and fought the storm for 3 hours. These tactics were
kept up for 16 hours. You may imagine how we all felt that long night in a narrow channel filled with rocks &amp; icebergs,
wind whistling through the riggings, men and women crying, some almost insane. Crew as badly frightened as the others
when the boat wouldn&#x27;t turn. We had to hold on chairs &amp; tables to keep from being thrown from one side of the boat to the
other. However we were all saved and I hope to have us all alive so I can tell you all particulars in the near future. We had to

stay in Skagway 3 weeks before we could get over the summit of the mountains. We had 4 dogs, one horse with us to bring
in our clothing, provisions and camping outfit. There were 4 in our party and it took 21 days from (illegible) to come in. We
followed the Yukon river nearly all the way, a distance of nearly 600 miles, walked all the way. We pitched our tent every
night, but two. The weather for 7 or 10 days was from 50 to 63 degrees below zero. The coldest night we kept fire for
ourselves and horse. It seems almost incredible for people to believe that have never experienced such extreme cold that it
possible to keep comfortable under such conditions. As a testimonial I&#x27;m alive and never felt stronger in my life. The only
bad features is, it is a very hard country on the hair. I am almost entirely gray, both beard &amp; hair. So don&#x27;t be surprised to see
a gray-haired son on my return. I sold my two dogs for $110. Had I got here 4 weeks earlier could have sold them for $150
each as there was a great demand for them by people going over the ice to Nome. Our party will remain here till the river
breaks up, then we will start for the same place. We expect to reach there about 3 weeks before the people do by the allwater route. At present, we are at work on a mine on Eldorado Creek, and one of the richest in this country. I can tell you
more in a half-hour when I see you than I can write in a week so will not attempt to write. I thought you would like to hear
from me from this point more especially that I am well. I heard from Anna and children through a letter dated the 20th of
Feb. They are well &amp; she is still teaching. Irma writes every week, so does Helen. They always write the new words she has
learned through the week. Anna &amp; I talked over my trip some time before I started and we came to the conclusion I had
better try once more and if do not make it this time will give it up and go back to the old way. I want to do well enough at
least to visit you all sometime next year. Shall not leave a stone unturned in the trial. I think Anna &amp; the children will go
home this summer. She is quite anxious to come north with me if I get hold of anything worth our attention. Well, Mother,
this is your birthday and all you can conceive how I should like to drop in and give you a surprise. I sincerely hope you &amp;
Father are well &amp; I will remain so to a good old age. I should like to be in a position to be present at all of your future
birthdays and be sure of a long list before me. Give my love to Caleb &amp; family, Oscar &amp; family &amp; I wish to be remembered
to all friends. Write me at Dawson, Yukon Territory and if it does not reach me in time, I will have it forwarded. I send a
kiss &amp; hug for each birthday. I should like to hear from Father, in fact from you all, in a long letter. Good bye, J. O. Hall
