            <div class="person-text">(2.1.3.3.1.1.2.5.5) MARY E. FERRIS born July 3, 1853 Milton WI and died May 24, 1913 Long
Beach CA; (she is on the family stone at North Johnstown Cemetery, Milton WI); married 1876 in
Milton, Charles M. Gates born February 19, 1855 Clinton Junction WI and died June 22, 1915. Mary
was educated at Milton College where she met Charles. Charles is known as the President and one of
three founder of the Creamery Package, and later Creamery Packing Manufacturing Company – the
leading dairy equipment manufacturer and supplier in the US, based primarily in the Midwest but with
offices from the west coast to the east coast and England as well. Charles was educated at Milton
College, BA 1876, MA 1879. It was several years after they were married that Mary’s extensive
number of brothers and sisters and brother-in-laws were integral in the formation of the company and
its continuation until after WWII. Charles originally taught school in Wyoming, Minnesota; Waupaca
and Berlin WI; operated a lumber yard at Clinton Junction WI; he was going into the egg-packing
business with his brother-in-law, William Lewis Ferris, when Charles came up with the brain storm of
establishing the butter tub manufacturing business in 1883. The Creamery Package Manufacturing Co
emerged from that start in 1887.</div>
