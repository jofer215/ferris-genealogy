            <div class="person-text">(5.1.2.6.5.6.1.2) CLISTA CELIA FERRIS (twin) born July 29, 1867 Cohocton NY and died July
1952, Campbell, Steuben, NY; buried Greenville Cemetery, Avoca NY; married three times:
1st December 16, 1886 in Avoca, Emery Orr Head [son of Jesse &amp; Cynthia (Briggs) Head] born
November 21, 1862 in Cohocton and died June 24, 1896 in Wheeler from internal injuries sustained in
a plowing accident; married 2d 1898 Louis Geraldine Myers [son of John] born April 9, 1853 in Paris,
France and died August 15, 1925, North Hornell NY; and 3d September 1, 1927 in Avoca, Jerry Elmer
House [son of Jacob &amp; Mary (Dockey) House] born in November 1860 in Howard and died c1942
Avoca. Notes from Annette (Myers) Campbell in her words: “Clista was 75 years old when I born. She
died when I was almost 10 years old and I remember her like it was yesterday. She was so sweet and
kind to everyone. Granny, as I called her always had to have the same plate, which was white ironstone
with a blue-checkered border for her meals, and the silverware had her initial C on it. She never wore
any new clothing that was given to her as a gift and when she died it was all packed neatly in her truck.
In her trunk, which was a small domed steamer one, she had many letters she had saved from friends
and family. I had no idea what became of them, probably thrown away. It would sure be nice to have
them now. Granny had a large old wooden rocking chair that I have a picture of her sitting in. When
she died it was donated to her daughters church for the ladies to rock their babies in. Home canning
was one of the things she liked to do every summer until everything in the large acre garden we had
was in a jar. She would at age 84 get up a 5 am to split some kindling for the small wood stove we had
in the kitchen. You see, Granny, Grandma &amp; Grandpa Myers, my Dad Emery &amp; Mom Eleanor as well
as my brother Ted and myself along with our Dalmatian dog Zenda and always a cat, lived together in
one house in Curtis NY beside the bank of the Cohocton River when she died. The only one of her
sisters that I knew was Ida, who lived in the old hotel on Main Street in Stephens Mills NY along with
her husband Uncle Fred Gesner. Their only child Bennett and his family lived next door to them. We
would take her there quite often for a visit. Aunt Ida was a very pleasant, tall, thin woman and Uncle
Fred was a joker most of the time. He would use his cane crook around my neck and pull me toward
him, which I thought was very funny. Granny’s sister Laura had died before I born but her daughter
Eva used to come to our house at least once a year to visit, sometimes for a few days at a time and I
grew to love her a lot. Her son Norman would sometimes bring her on a short visit. She was a beautiful
lady in manner as well as looks. Her hair was a stunning white and she dressed very well. She looked
much like her mother as I can see from photos that I have. Aunt Roxy, Granny’s twin sister died 1926
and I never knew any of her family. I would love to find some track of her grandson Clyde House’s
family. He would have been born about 1910 I believe in Alberta, Canada. Clyde and his mother later

moved to Anten Mills, Ontario, Canada. I have a postcard dated 1913 from his mother Anna with him
sitting backwards on a mule with another small child in Rocky Mountain House, Alberta. Uncle Jerry
House died about 1941/42 before I born. They had a double stone in Mitchellville Cemetery, but as the
welfare took him to Avoca to be buried in Highland Cemetery, they did not lie together. The four Ferris
Girls were a family to be very proud of.” Born to Clista and Emery was:</div>
