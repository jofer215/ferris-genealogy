            <div class="person-text">(2.1.3.3.2.4.1.4) WILLIAM OWEN SMITH (W.O.) (Photograph) born August 4, 1848 Koloa, Kauai,
HI and died April 13, 1929 at his Nu’uanu home. As soon as William was old enough, he accompanied
his father on his emergency rides all over the island. The young boy learned to speak fluent Hawaiian
and developed a commitment to quiet, unheroic charity that would largely pass unnoticed, but which
would be the guardian of his conscience all his life. His early education was the Rev. Daniel Dole’s
school at Koloa. His parents later sent him to Punahou, which he left to work on a sugar plantation,
laboring the fields in summer and the boiling house in the winter. After three years, he was easily
persuaded to continue his education and went off to the Massachusetts Agricultural College at
Amherst. Upon his return to Hawaii in 1870, he served as Sheriff of Kauai for two years. While
working in a similar capacity on Maui, he became acquainted with Judge Alfred S. Hartwell, who
guided him into a career in law, and who became his brother-in-law. W.O. was admitted to practice
before the Supreme Court of the Kingdom, 1875. He was deputy attorney general of the Kingdom for
nearly seven years, and later, attorney general of both the Provisional Government and the Republic.
He also served as President of the Board of Health. He was elected to the Hawaiian Legislature, serving
intermittently for 20 years and through four governments: the Kingdom, the Provisional Government,
the Republic, and the Territory. He was president of the Territorial Senate during his last two years in
office. Smith was on nearly every important board of directors in his day, serving as president of the
Guardian Trust Company, President of the Bishop Trust Company, an incorporator of Haleakala Ranch,
and trustee of the Hawaiian Sugar Planters Association, the Bishop Estate, Alexander Young Estate,
Lunalilo Estate and, of course, the Queen Ililuokalani Trust and Childrens Hospital. He was director
of many corporations, including the Inter-Island Steam Navigation Company and Alexander &amp; Baldwin
Ltd. He carried his propensity for being in the thick of things into the private arena and was president
of the board of trustees of KawaiaHao Church, a charter member of Central Union Church, a member
of Koloa Church and chairman of the finance committee of the Hawaiian Board of American
Missionaries. He was also the founder of the Christian Endeavor Society, a charitable group. Socially,
he was a member of the Pacific, University and Oahu County clubs. He married Mary Abbey ‘Minnie’
Hobron, a ‘Maui girl’, daughter of a Haliimaile sugar planter. For a while, Smith practiced law with
Lorrin Thurston and then set up his own legal practice in 1888, during the reign of King Kalakaua. He
hung out his shingle at 66 Fort Street. As his practice grew and he took in partners, he moved to the
Judd Building. The firm he founded a century ago continues today (1988) as Case &amp; Lynch. Smith’s

name appears on the Committee of Safety that instigated the Hawaiian Revolution, but it was W.O.,
that Queen Liliuokalani called for when she decided to leave her estate for the benefit of orphaned and
destitute children. He was employed to establish her trust and he defended her sanity when the Queen’s
disgruntled relatives sought to break her will; they tried to claim she was incompetent. Smith won the
case. As Smith states it, “One of the gratifying experiences of my life was that after the trying period
which led up to the overthrow of the monarchy and the withdrawal of Queen Liliuokalini, the queen
sent for me to prepare a will and deed of trust and appointed me one of her trustees.” According to
family tradition, Smith planted the banyan sapling at Lahaina, Maui,(1873) which today has grown to
enormous proportions and is a favorite tourist stop on Maui. Born to them were:</div>
