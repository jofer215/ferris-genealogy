From the Finger Lakes Times (Wayne County, New York), 6 JAN 1983. Written by Daniel Berger:
SAVANNAH - Herman Hall has lived on East Church Street for 38 years. And he can tell you where to find him for eternity,
too, because he&#x27;s got his resting place already picked out. When Hall dies, he will be laid to rest in the Ferris Cemetery also known as Pilgrim&#x27;s Rest Cemetery - on Hadden Road, in a plot that has been in his family for nearly a century. When
his time comes, Hall will join seven generations of his family that have been buried in Ferris Cemetery, and nine
generations of Halls that have been buried in Savannah. Hall isn&#x27;t exactly on his deathbed, though. He&#x27;s 71 years old and
feisty enough to have raised the dead for a half-hour at a recent Savannah Town Board meeting. Hall told the board it has a
responsibility to take care of the Ferris Cemetery, named for one of its occupants, Hall&#x27;s great-grandfather, Joseph Ferris.
And Hall let the board know that he didn&#x27;t like the disappearance of another, smaller cemetery on Wilsey Road, which he
said was swallowed up when the town widened the road. The first Halls to settle in Savannah are buried in that cemetery,
referred to in old records as the Gravelly Graveyard. Aaron (1764-1824), Herman Hall&#x27;s great-great-great-grandfather, and
Aaron Jr. (1786-1824), left Mansfield, Conn. in 1815 to sink new roots in Savannah. Hall lived near the graveyard as a child
and can remember passing one surviving gravestone on his way to the old Cook&#x27;s Grammar School, which stood on nearby
Cook&#x27;s Hill Road. That single tombstone was observed in 1940 during a tombstone count taken by the Daughters of the
American Revolution, Hall said. Someone reported seeing it in a ditch a quarter-mile away years ago, he said, but nothing
was ever done about it. Hall said he&#x27;d be willing to put up new stones to mark the approximate graves of his ancestors, if the
town would mark and fence off the property. Supervisor Donald G. Colvin said the matter was complicated because the
property isn&#x27;t marked on deeds of the surrounding property. Colvin asked Councilman Russell Hadden, whose parents live
nearby, to check into it. According to state law, said Wayne County Historian Marjory Allen Perez, towns are responsible for
old or abandoned cemeteries. There are more than 100 cemeteries in Wayne County, she said, including small family plots
which get harder to find as they deteriorate and the earth swallows them up. The Gravelly Graveyard was on the southeast
corner of property once owned by the first Aaron Hall, said his descendant. Hall believes the exact site is now a roadside

ditch at Wilsey and Reed roads. A hedgerow stretching from there to Hadden Road marks the southern boundary of the
original Aaron Hall property. Hall said he has been interested in the cemeteries since he was a child because of the personal
history they contain. And he&#x27;s been taking care of the southern half of the Ferris Cemetery for many years. His care has
made a dramatic difference in the graveyard&#x27;s appearance. The half he tends is level and neatly mowed, with properly
aligned gravestones. The other half, where Joseph Ferris rests, is overgrown with weeds. Monuments there teeter in every
direction on uneven ground. &quot;The stones (on our half) were sunk, too, just like the others, when I started,&quot; Hall said. &quot;I
raised them with dirt, leveled them, seeded and turfed all around. If someone wanted to do something for the community,
and put his back into it, it could be the way it should be.&quot; Hall has a thick file devoted to his family&#x27;s genealogy. A cousin of
his, George Pink of California, has done extensive research in recent years to document the family&#x27;s history. Eecords from
the Plymouth, Mass., library and other records have confirmed a direct line of Halls going back to Theophilus, 1719-1747.
The birth and death dates of Theophilus&#x27;s father, Lt. William Hall, are uncertain, Herman Hall said, but he&#x27;s hoping the
lieutenant&#x27;s father will be shown to have been a Mayflower passenger. Hall&#x27;s cousin also used what are said to be the best
genealogical records in the world, belonging to the Mormon Church in Salt Lake City. Mormon missionary Hugh Cecil of
Lyons said church workers compile every birth and death record they can find, Mormon and non-Mormon alike. Mormons
believe in baptizing people posthumously, Cecil said, to give them a chance to accept the Gospel when already in the
afterlife. So Hall has a long family tree to keep track of, one that along one line stretches back to 1540 in England. From
Aaron Hall to Michelle Hall, a six-year-old girl who died in an auto accident in 1977, nine generations of his family are
buried in Savannah. A grandson, John Hall II, died a day after his birth last February in Phoenix, Ariz., where Hall&#x27;s son
John lives. But the infant&#x27;s body was shipped back to Savannah so that it could be buried in the family plot in the Ferris
Cemetery. Hall tends the child&#x27;s grave, as he does those of his other relatives. And he&#x27;s sure that when his time comes,
another Hall will take care of him.</div>
