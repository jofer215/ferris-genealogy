            <div class="person-text">(5.1.2.6.4.4.5) HENRY LAKIN FERRIS born September 24, 1850 Prattsville, Greene, NY and died
May 20, 1932 Alden IL; married c1873 in Greene Co, Millie F. Mosher born 1853 Greene Co and died

Carrier (see photos). These carriers were cast at Rockford and put together in Harvey. In addition to
their carriers, Hunt, Helm &amp; Ferris carried a full and complete line of the latest and most improved hay
