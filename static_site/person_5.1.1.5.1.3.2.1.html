            <div class="person-text">(5.1.1.5.1.3.2.1) NEWTON D. FERRIS - the following is speculation based on his parent’s marriage
date and the fact that Ira in Cayuga County is an adjacent county to Oswego County, and Newton is
identified as being from Ira. The Oswego County NY webpage on www.rootsweb.com has a series of
letters from Chauncy A. Smith to his wife during the Civil War. In those letters he mentions Newton
Ferris who was his tent-mate. They were in Company F, 111th Infantry Regiment, New York
Volunteers. The letters are interesting reading as they depict soldier life during the Civil War. The letter
depicts how Newton was captured and it is learned, later died a Confederate POW Camp.”October 18,
1864, Camp before Petersburg: Monday night Mr. Ferris and Mr. Mainard of Lysander came into camp.
I was glad to see their familiar faces. . . . Newton Ferris is tenting with me and I find his company
agreeable. . . I have just come to my tent from a drill. John, my friend was out on fatigue duty in the
night in company with Newton Ferris, for those who are on fatigue duty in the night are exempt from
drill the next day. Newton had just come in from the post office with the Tribune. I asked him if the
news of Sheridan’s last victory was in the paper. He said, ‘Yes,’, so we all sat down in the tent to hear
the good news read. While Mr. Ferris has been reading, seven have passed over our camp from the
Rebel Battery, and not a great way over eight, but I am thankful that as yet today no one has been hurt.”
“October 30, 1864, Newton Ferris said that he had been in the army almost three years and remarked to
me that it was about as hard a time as he had seen in his whole service.” He was talking about a march
they were on. “On the 2d day of November, Mr. Ferris of Ira, John Howard of the town of Rose, and
John O’Brian of Syracuse with myself were detailed to go on picket about three miles to the left, for the
first time and it proved to be the last time for Ferris and Howard. We arrived at the picket line at 6
o’clock in the evening, we were posted and told that we would be relieved in 24 hours and so we were,
but not by Union soldiers. This picket that we were on had just been formed without any reserve picket
to protect it. The Johnnies had been informed of the situation and they made a raid on our line the next
night about 5 p.m. and gobbled up, I should think about 150 of our pickets in good style, of whom I
was one. I should judge that there were about four or five hundred of the raiders and when they got into
the rear of our picket line they formed themselves into a hollow square, having guards 4 deep all
around the square. We pickets were looking to the front of the enemy and not the rear, consequently we
were taken by surprise and were not prepared to defend ourselves. The front ranks of this square were
in blue clothes that they had gotten from deserters and this too threw us off our guard as they
approached us. When they came up to our post they had some five or six big lusty fellows outside of
their ranks to disarm us and shove us into the trap with a rush. …. When they had their square filled
with out pickets they started for their lines acting as though they felt jolly over their game they had
played.” Chauncy later escaped but Newton and Howard did not.
