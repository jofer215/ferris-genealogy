&quot;(1905) James S. Miles, a son of James and Anna Miles, who are residents of Petersburg and are
mentioned elsewhere in this volume, was the fourth in a family of five children and born January 16,
1859, upon the farm where his father now resides. There he was reared. No event of special
importance occurred to vary the routine of farm life for him in his youth. He pursued his education in
the Barclay school and Petersburg high school, and when he had completed the course he engaged in
teaching, first in country schools and afterward in Petersburg, being identified with its educational
interests for a year.
At the end of that time Mr. Miles was married, March 1, 1882, to Miss Nellie Purkapile, a
daughter of James Purkapile. Mrs. Miles came into possession of the farm on which they now reside
and they still have the original deed to this land, signed by John Adams. Her grandfather, John
Purkapile, obtained the land from the government and at his death his estate was divided among his
children and a part of it was inherited by the father of Mrs. Miles and in turn came into her possession.
The land just across the road was formerly the property of Judge Harrison, born upon the place. The
name Purkapile is of German lineage and the family was Pennsylvania German people connected with
the Keystone state in a very early period in its development. John Purkapile married Mary Ellen Boyer
and died October 4, 1846, at the age of sixty-five years, four months and sixteen days. The
grandmother of Mrs. Miles reached the very advanced age of ninety-three years.
Mrs. Miles acquired her education in the common schools at Walnut Ridge. By her marriage she
became the mother of three children but the eldest died in infancy. James S., born June 5, 1888, is now
attending school at Petersburg, being in the second year in the high school. Anna Catherine, the
youngest born June 5, 1902.
Both Mr. and Mrs. Miles hold membership in the Christian church and he votes with the
Republican Party. He carries on general farming, now owning over three hundred and thirty-two acres,
and is also engaged in feeding and shipping cattle. He has been quite prosperous in his business affairs
and most of his success has been attained through hard labor. His property is now valuable, giving
evidence of his careful supervision in the many modern improvements he has placed upon it.&quot;
&quot;(1943) James S. Miles, well known citizen of Menard county, and for many years a leader in
Illinois state fair activities, has a recipe for both old age and happiness. &#x27;Get married early to a good,
Christian girl, behave yourself and work hard,&#x27; is his rule.

Miles, long a Republican enthusiast, and one time close friend of Gov. Len Small, was 89 years
in January. Mrs. Miles died in February. Had she lived a month longer, they would have been married
66 years.
Miles, still in vigorous health, was in the city calling on friends. While here, he reminisced over
events of a quarter of a century ago, and before. His grandfather was among those who met at
Bloomington in 1854 to organize the Republican Party in Illinois. Both the grandfather and the father
knew Abraham Lincoln, the grandfather having been one of the Emancipator&#x27;s close friends.
For several years, Miles was a member of the Illinois State Fair advisory board and for a time
served as its president. During the Small administration, he helped direct every state fair held during
the eight years.&quot;
