            <div class="person-text">(3.1.1.1.5.7) ENOCH MEAD FERRIS, Deacon, born March 16, 1801 Rensselear Co NY and died
October 4, 1881/83 Mexico NY; married 1st May 19, 1833/35 Mary Ann Nye who died April 25, 1838;
married 2d September 5, 1839 Catherine Burgett who died April 17, 1840; buried South Richland
Cemetery, Pulaski, Oswego, NY (Cemetery Photo); and married 3d January 24, 1842 Elizabeth
Douglass born August 23, 1803 Westmoreland NY and died September 24, 1902. In her 97 th year,
Elizabeth wrote: “I became a resident of South Richland (Oswego County NY) in 1824, when I united
with that church by letter from Whitesboro. The church was small, consisting mostly of elderly people.
I think I was the youngest member, Rev. Enoch Ferris, the father of my husband, E.M. Ferris, was the
pastor. I never heard of their having any previous pastor. As he was a former missionary for that county,
it seems natural to suppose that he was the one who assisted in forming the church. I was a member of
the church several years before my brother Colonel John Douglass, was converted and united with it. I
can mention some of the early members, but cannot tell whether they were the first, though I think
likely they were. They were Rev. Enoch Ferris, his wife and daughter Elizabeth; Deacon Bangs,
Deacon Bumpus, and their wives; John Holmes, clerk; Mrs. (Roxy) Dewey; and Mrs. Hiel Richards
later.” Elizabeth was gifted and educated, a successful teacher in her maiden years.</div>
