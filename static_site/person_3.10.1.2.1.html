            <div class="person-text">(3.10.1.2.1) JOHN PECK born November 12, 1742 Greenwich CT and died September 19, 1819
Sherburne, Chenango Co NY; buried North Norwich Cemetery; married November 12, 1766 (or

October, 1764), Sarah Northrup {dau of Nathan – descendent of the first Northrup in America} born
October 28, 1746/8 North Salem NY and died November 3/11, 1830 Smyrna, Chenango, NY age 85y;
buried with John. John served in the French War, 1759-1763. In 1771, he moved from Greenwich to
the Dutchess Co where he lived in the Great Nine Partners area. At the beginning of the Revolutionary
War, John was in the militia. In 1772, he removed to Great Nine Partners, in that part now Stanford,
Dutchess County NY. On December 26, 1776, he enlisted for three years under Captain Thomas Lee in
the Eighth Company of the Fifth Regiment of the New York Line of which Colonel Lewis Dubois was
the Commander. On February 10, 1777, he transferred to the Second Battalion of the New York troops
under Colonel Wempell. He apparently fought in the battles of White Plains, Long Island, Fort
Washington, Fort Plains and Saghabor. It appears that he was in the Army at the capture of Fort
Montgomery and he was taken prisoner during the battle. He continued in the service until January
1782. In 1792, he moved to the west of the Hudson River, in Greene County NY. In February 1795, he
moved his family to Sherburne, Chenango County NY where he settled and remained until his death.
His occupation, through life, was that of a farmer, being principally engaged in felling the forest and in
the clearing up and cultivation of his land. He was a man of superior natural talents, great firmness and
energy, one of the enterprising valuable pioneers in the settlement of New York State. Born to John and
Sarah were:</div>
