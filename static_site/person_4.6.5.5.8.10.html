(4.6.5.6) SILAS HAIT (#2902) was baptized March 25, 1738/39 and was living after 1802, apparently
in Amsterdam NY, with a daughter who married a Mr. Ambler. Silas was blind and it is supposed he
lost his sight after arriving at manhood. He was a devout Presbyterian and after returning from a
meeting, could repeat much of the sermon and sign the psalms and hymns employed. It is said he could
repeat any verse in the Bible to which his attention was called; married November 14, 1765 in
Stamford, Sarah Lockwood.</div>
