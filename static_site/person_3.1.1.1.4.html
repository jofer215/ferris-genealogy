            <div class="person-text">(3.1.1.1.4) JOHN FERRIS, JR. born c1757 and died September 23, 1800 at age 43y; originally buried
on the Ferris Family Farm in Sycamore Township; moved to Sycamore Township Memorial Cemetery,
Hamilton Co OH 1931; DAR marker for Rev. War Veteran. [He is referred to as Senior on cemetery
records.] This John must have been the John Ferris, Jr., (?) in the Albany Co militia in the Revolution,
as his father was the only other known John Ferris in that county at that time; also served in the Indian
warfare in Ohio, where he was on the payroll of Captain Richard Greaton’s Company, First Sub-Legion
of the United States Army, for a little over two months in 1793. John’s cousin Ezra stated that John
was a Lieutenant of the first military company organized in that area and served under General
Anthony Wayne in his campaign, which ended in 1795. John and his wife are said to have moved
directly to Columbia, although they may have landed on the Kentucky shore first until cabins were
built in the new settlement at the mouth of the Little Miami River in 1789. They were charter members
of the Baptist Church at Columbia in 1790, but were dismissed in 1792, probably to the church at Duck
Creek. Family tradition has him leaving Albany, NY and sailing down the Hudson to join the party
migrating to Ohio. John and his wife were buried in the cemetery on the original Ferris farm in
Sycamore Township, Hamilton County, OH, but about 1931 their remains were removed to the Mount
Carmel Cemetery in the same township. John married Betsy (Elizabeth) Denton [dau of Solomon and
Lydia (Husted) Denton.] who died March 2, 1814 at age 55y; buried at Sycamore Township Cemetery.
