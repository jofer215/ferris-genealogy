            <div class="person-text">(1.1.4.4.1.3.6.6) LESTER SIMON CHRISTESON (Photo) born August 18, 1898
Barron, Barron, WI and died April 4, 1992 at the Knapp Haven Rest Home, Chetek,
Barron, WI; buried Wayside Cemetery, Barron. Lester took over the operation of the
Arland Township farm after the death of his brother Howard and later became the owner.
This farm had been logged of pine during the lumbering days and consisted mostly of
second growth timber and hardwood which had not been worth logging during the

lumber days; probably only about 20 acres of this 100 acre farm had been cleared for
crops. The main source of income for the farm was money received from other farmers
who pastured their young stock there during the summer months and the maple syrup
Lester evaported from the fine stand of sugar maple trees. Thsi farm adjoined the one
owned by Marie Christeson and her daughter, Benjaline H. Brown. Lester also operated
a truck garden on another property and his primary crop was strawberries and sweet
corn. He also raised plant sets and tomatoes. He had sold the farm and the lot and was
retired and living with his sister Florence, prior to entering the Knapp Haven Rest
Home. Lester’s health required care that the rest home could provide, however, his mind
was as sharp as ever. He read the newspaper every day and also listened to his record
collection of classical music or the same music on the radio - unmarried</div>
