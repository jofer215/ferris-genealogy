Sate Supreme Court (1901-12); his papers are at the U of Iowa Library; was brought by his parents to
Tipton IA 1855. His father, who had been owner and principal of an academy in Ohio, came to Cedar
Co Iowa, with the intention of farming, but taught school in Tipton for one year and at Rochester for
another year, after which he opened a farm in the same county, which was the family home until
removal to Wilton in 1864. In 1866 the family removed to Iowa city, where the father became the
owner of the Commercial College and established an academy and the son entered the University,
graduating in 1871 with the degree of Ph. B. and completing his law course in the same institution in
1873, from which he also in 1891 received the degree of Doctor of Laws. Mr. McClain practiced law in

Senate from 1875 to 1877. While residing in Des Moines he also prepared McClain&#x27;s Annotated

bringing it down to the present has just been published), and a new edition of the Annotated Statutes of
Iowa, under the title &quot;McClain&#x27;s Annotated Code,&quot; published in 1888. In 1896 he published a collection
of cases on the Law of Carriers, in 1897 a treatise on the Criminal Law now administered in the United
States (American Citizen series), 1905; and articles on Carriers, Insurance, Fire Insurance and Life

the statutes of Iowa, and he furnished the annotations for the code, adopted in 1897, and subsequent
supplements. He was nominated at the Republican State Convention in 1900 for Judge of the Supreme
