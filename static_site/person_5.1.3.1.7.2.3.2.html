            <div class="person-text">(5.1.3.1.7.2.3.2) HENRY C. FERRIS (Photos) born June 26, 1835/6 on the farm near Newbury OH
and buried February 20, 1912; buried Ferris Center Cemetery, Ferris Township, Montcalm County MI.
The death of his father left him to shift for himself, and for three years he lived with an aunt. Then
until his marriage he worked at whatever he could get to do. In 1853, with the idea of locating in a new
country and growing up with it, he went to Michigan, and in the town of Ferris, Montcalm County,

worked one year for his Uncle Elijah Ferris, who was the first settler in the township. He worked out
by day and month until 1856, when, with the little means left him from his father&#x27;s estate, he bought the
northwest quarter of the northwest quarter (80 acres) of Section 24 in Ferris Township. He married,
March 16, 1857, Louise M. Blodgett [dau of Luther &amp; Lucy (Ford) Blodgett] born April 24, 1839 in
Eaton Rapids MI and died April 22, 1900; buried with Henry. The next fall after their marriage, Henry
bought Louise to Ferris and (in the shanty built by his uncle when he first came) commenced
housekeeping. Here they lived until the next fall, by which time he had made a start on his land and had
built a log house. It had a floor of split logs and was the result of his own handiwork. Out of the
shanty, which was many times used by newcomers, they moved into their new home, in which they
pass many happy hours. They were poor in purse, but rich in health and strength and determination.
After getting into his house, Henry had but five dollars left. He at once cleared and put in a couple of
acres of wheat, but it was a failure, and to keep the wolf from the door he worked in the woods, and
this way got a start. The most of the first winters work was lost, and this made the times very hard; but
splitting rails at fifty cents per day bought flour at six dollars per hundred, and prevented hunger. Their
milling in those days was done at Matherton, and the trip, made with oxen, required three days hard
work, and then three days work for the use of the team. By dint of hard work, coupled with good
management, Henry accumulated one hundred and ten acres of fine land, with a good house, and
outbuildings. With sixty-two acres under improvement, Henry ranked as one of Ferris’ best farmers.
In politics, he was a Republican of the radical type, holding township offices many times. In 1863, he
was treasurer of four towns in one, also justice of the peace, and many years’ highway commissioner
and school officer and was the first assessor of his school district. Born to them were:</div>
