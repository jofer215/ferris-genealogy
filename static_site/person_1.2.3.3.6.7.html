(1.2.3.3.6.7.1) JOHN WOODRUFF SYPHERS (going back to original spelling as that is
how source has it) born c1823 Vails Gate, New Winsor, Orange, NY and found dead
December 17, 1863, in the bush, 3 miles from South Gundagai, New South Wales,
supposedly fell from a horse; buried in the General Cemetery, North Gundagai; he
arrived in Australia on the ship Kelso 1848, as a member of the crew – he joined the
crew of the Kelso in London 1847 signing on for 2 years and was 1 of 5 crew members
that deserted when the ship arrived in Sidney; naturalized 1857; The Wynard Times, 21
December 1863 reads: “It is with regret that we have to record the death of Mr. John
Syphers, the more especially that it occurred in so sad a manner. For some years past he
deceased had beenc complaining, now and then, of severe pains in the chest, which his
medical advisor attributed to disease of the heart. Early on last Thursday morning he
started from his house at Tarrabandra to go to Gundagai and see the advise of a medical
man, having suffered more than usually from his affliction. About 11 o’clock on the
same day, two brothers found the body of the unfortunate man stretched out by the side
of the road, and supposing him to be asleep, one of the boy got off his horse to awake
him, but found to his amazement that his life was gone. One of the youths remained with
the body while the other returned to Gundagai and gave information to the police. The
body was conveyed to Gundagai and an inquest held the same day, and on Friday
forenoon waster interred in the cemetery at North Gundagai. During the many years that
Mr Syphers exercised his vocation of blacksmith in this town, he was universally
respected, as joined to his excellence as a tradesman there was a warmheartedness which
brought him many friends. He leaves a widow and seven children. It will probably
afford some consolation to those who have most cause to mourn his death, that the
sympathy expressed for their loss is universal”; married October 29, 1851 in Tumut,
New South Wales, Mary Anne Real [dau of Bartholomew &amp; Mary (Doherty) Real] born
January 3, 1828 Pittwater, NSW and died May 18, 1899 Grahams Town, NSW; buried
Adelong; and born to them were:</div>
