Born August 21, 1923 in St. Louis, Dr. von Pagenhardt lived in Carmel Valley the past
30 years. Dr. von Pagenhardt served as interim president of the Monterey Institute of
International Studies in 1977 and was on the institute’s board of directors from 1976 to

Kathi Wojtkowski, executive assistant to the school’s president. A graduate of the School
of Foreign Service at Georgetown U., Dr. von Pagenhardt’s primary interests were
national and international security management, futures research, strategic planning and
science policy. ‘He had an unbelievable knowledge of history and its applications to
today’s society and needs,’ said his friend, Hugh Barton of Carmel Valley. He was a life
member of the American Foreign Service Association and Sons of the American
Revolution. His many memberships also included the United Nations Association and
the World Federation of Future Studies. Dr. von Pagenhardt served in the Army during
WWII and was chief noncommissioned officer for civil affairs in the Philippines at the
war’s end. He studied at Stanford U., earning a doctorate in political science and history
in 1970, and also at the universities of Bordeaux and Paris. Before joining the American
Foreign Service in 1956, Dr. von Pagenhardt interned as a staff aide to U.N. SecretaryGeneral Trygve Lie. Prior to coming to teach in Monterey in 1967, Dr. von Pagenhardt

held several posts with UN groups and US overseas missions. He was an economic and
consular officer in the US embassy in Pakistan from 1959 to 1961 and served with the
US mission in NATO from 1962 to 1967. Dr. von Pagenhardt retired in 1996, but
continued to work at the Naval Post-graduate School and Defense Resources
Management Institute as a professor emeritus. He also was executive secretary of the
Higher Education Association of the Monterey Bay. He belonged to St. Dunstan’s
Episcopal Church, the Old Capital Club, and Rotary International. He was co-author of a
1992 book entitled: To Unite our Strength: Enhancing the United Nations Peace and
Security System. He served on the board of directors of the Monterey Peninsula
Salvation Army for the past 15 years. A dedicated sailor, he was a former commodore of
the Monterey Peninsula Yacht Club and enjoyed swimming and skiing. He is survived
