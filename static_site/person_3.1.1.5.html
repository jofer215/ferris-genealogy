            <div class="person-text">(3.1.1.5) REUBEN FERRIS (AFN: 8RLL-R5) born c1732 New York and died October 1, 1804
Morristown (near Elizabethtown) NJ; Sergeant, 8th Company, 4th Regiment, 1755; First Lieutenant,
5th Company, 4th Regiment, 1756; First Lieutenant, 6th Company, 1st Regiment, 1757 under Captain
David Waterbury; and he served as a Lieutenant Colonel, 7th Regiment, New York Troops, in the
Revolutionary War and was called Colonel Ferris thereafter. There was a Captain Reuben Ferris who
had a company of Rangers at No. 4, 1757-58 – not sure if this is the same guy. Reuben married before
1760 Sarah Strong (AFN: 8RLM-B2) [daughter of Rev. Benjamin Strong who was Pastor of Stanwich
Congregational Church 1735-1767]; resided in Greenwich until at least 1774 when they were listed as
members of the Second Congregational there, but removed to Frederickstown, then part of Dutchess Co
NY by 1777, when he was on the tax list; a farmer; bought 140 acres in Philipse Long Lot (No. 6) on
the east side of the Lot, and running west to Mill river 140 acres, being the north part of the part on
which Reuben lived 1791, from Mrs. Margaret Ogilvie. On June 27, 1796, he sold 140 acres in Phillips
Long Lot, Dutchess County to Solomon Fowler, and it was probably about this time that he moved to
New Jersey, where he died near Elizabethtown as the result of being thrown from a horse. He died
intestate. Born to them were (may be more) (sequence not according to birth):</div>
