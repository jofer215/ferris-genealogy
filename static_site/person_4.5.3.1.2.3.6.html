            <div class="person-text">(4.5.3.1.2.3.6) JOHN ASHLEY LOCKWOOD (#2227) born 1823 Peekskill NY (in Shrub Oak NY
c1821); 1881 resided at No. 9, St. Mark’s Place, NYC; and died March 9, 1895 Rockwood,
Cumberland Co TN. John left Shrub Oak to make his fortune in the City. He and Hannah were married
by the Rev. Geissenhainer; he a grocer aged 23 years residing at 76 Clinton Street, and she, aged 16,
residence 117 Essex Street. Later he branched out into a commission dry goods business on Canal
Street, and had two mills for the making of linings. Although he was quite successful in business,
making enough to get all his children well started on their education, he was restless and wanted to
make a fortune. In 1859 he bought a 17-acre estate near Peekskill for $1750.00. In 1867 he sold this to
his mother-in-law, Elizabeth Mott for #2000.00; she sold this back to her daughter Hannah in 1876.
After the Civil War he decided to try something completely new, and hearing that minerals had been
discovered in the mountains of Tennessee, he decided to invest in these. So he sold his large estate near
Peekskill, set up his wife and younger children in New York, and with his eldest son, John, Jr., set off
for Tennessee. “Things went from bad to worse in the mountains, the railroad they had counted on left
them many miles in the lurch and he was never able to return to New York with the fortune he dreamed
of. He died down there March 9, 1895, and came home finally to New York only to be buried in
Greenwood.” He made and lost several fortunes and was striving to make another near Rugby on the
Cumberland Mountains, where he had 1600 acres. He married June 4, 1844 at NYC Hannah Elizabeth
Mott [dau of Gilbert &amp; Elizabeth (Hauxhurst) Mott] born October 13, 1830 (c1828) Oyster Bay, Long
Island and died Mt. Vernon NY 1902. Born to them were:</div>
