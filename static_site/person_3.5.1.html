            <div class="person-text">(3.5.1) JOSEPH FERRIS born c1739/40 Greenwich [twenty-one in 1761] (Jim - this means his father,
Caleb was 61 when Joseph born - one could assume that this birth date might be wrong; then again,
maybe not!) [Chaplain Ferris notes that he places Joseph’s offspring, solely on the flimsy coincidence

of the name of Jabez. To be consistent then, if these are his kids, then his birth date is definitely wrong,
considering the birth dates of the kids. Mead places the offspring with Joseph (3.4.3), which is where I
have them listed, right or wrong, for now.]</div>
