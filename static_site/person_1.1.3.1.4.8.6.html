            <div class="person-text">(1.1.3.1.4.8.6) ZAIDEE PERONNE BLAKENEY &quot;Peronne&quot; born March 24, 1876 St.
Louis MO. After she graduated from the Girls’ High School in Brooklyn, she took a

position in the actuarial department of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company of NY,
from which she resigned to be married. She married, April 29, 1905 in Brooklyn, Neil
McLeod Whittaker [son of Alfred &amp; Elizabeth (McLeod) Whittaker] born February 1,
1878, Brooklyn. He graduated from P.S. No. 35 when he was 13 years of age and
entered the employ of H.K. Brewer &amp; Co., stationers, of NYC. After several years he
entered night school, and was able one 1-½ years to pass the entrance exam and become
a student of the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia U. After his graduation
he traveled 3 months in Europe and on his return opened an office in Brooklyn, where he
practiced medicine for 10 years. He was in charge of the milk station financed by
Nathan Strauss, which was the first in NYC and later opened a number of others in the
city, assuming charge of one of them for 8 years. He was visiting physician to the
children’s ward of the Methodist Episcopal Hospital in Brooklyn, and gave his services
at various times to the free clinics of the Brooklyn Hospital and the Long Island College
Hospital. During WWI he worked on various drives and was untiring in giving his time
and himself to the needy families of the soldiers at the front. During the infantile
paralysis epidemic in Brooklyn, he worked days and nights as one of the appointed
diagnosticians of that place. In 1924 he invented and patented a device known as Revira
for cleaning and polishing the teeth. Despite suffering and ill health, added to the cares
and responsibilities of a doctor’s wife, Peronne found time to devote to other people. At
one time she took a tiny incubator baby into her home and kept her there, under the
supervision of her husband, until she could have care that was not professional without
endangering her life. At the same time she offered to take another child who was very ill,
promising to return him home cured after 3 weeks treatment by her husband, but this
offer was refused, the child’s family feeling that with her own baby and the incubator
baby and only one nurse, that the added care would be too great, but as the child grew
steadily worse, the offer was finally accepted and the promise made was fulfilled.
During WWI she was slowly recovering from a very serious operation and was obliged
to confine her work to knitting for the soldiers, of which she completed many articles for
their warmth and comfort. Born to them were:</div>
