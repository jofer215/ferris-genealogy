            <div class="person-text">(1.4.1.11) GEORGE FERRIS
I do not know if this is the same George Ferris, but on February 11, 1792, George Ferris
and Edward Ferris were indicted, in New York City Court, for assault on Martin
McEvoy. They both plead guilty and were fined 28s. 8d. each.
On November 12, 1792, a George Ferris was indicated, in New York City Court, for
petty larceny. He was convicted and sentenced to gaol for 15 days.
On July 7, 1797, a Samuel Gidney was indicted for assault and battery on George
Ferris; he plead not guilty. He was tried on July 8, and found not guilty.
From Life in the Bronx, October, 1953.
The Bronx has been largely peopled and enriched during the past fifty years by
successive tides of immigrants from many lands and we normally think of the average
Bronxite as a first or second generation American. Without ever giving it any conscious
thought I had always assumed Dick Ferris [Richard S.], of Ferris Buick, Inc., fell in this
category and I was both surprised and curious to learn the other day that one of our

Bronx streets had been named for his family. Here was a fact of Life in the Bronx worth
investigating. I chased over to Ferris Buick to see what could be learned. I was able to
unearth the fact that a genealogy of the Ferris family was in the 42d Street Library and
from its pages I obtained the story.
The Branch of the Ferris family for whom Ferris Avenue and Ferris Place are named
stems from John Ferris, who emigrated to Throggs Neck from Fairfield CT, in 1654. He
had nine children. During the Revolutionary War, when the British forces, under General
Lord Howe invaded Throggs Neck, the house of James, one of the children, was used by
them as headquarters. James Ferris was captured by the Queens Rangers during the
fighting and subsequently died of the result of the rigors of his captivity. The roster of
New York State troops who took part in the Revolutionary War for Westchester and
Dutchess Counties, list fifty-one members of the Ferris family.
