            <div class="person-text">(3.1.1.3.1.4) BETSEY REYNOLDS born September 1, 1786 Cross River, Westchester, NY and died
there June 12, 1830; married December 27, 1803 at Cross River, Gideon Reynolds who died 1783 at
either Poundridge or Lewisboro NY. [He was the son of William and Mary (Polly) (Knapp) Reynolds.]
He served in the War of 1812 from September 15 to October 14, 1812, with his cousins Andrew and
Ambrose, in the Militia Company of Captain Horton Reynolds, also their cousin. Gideon was the
owner and operator of a stage coach line which operated from Danbury CT to New York City, running
through White Plains NY. In 1829, he built the splendid big red brick tavern at Cross River, which he
operated as a halfway house for the stage run of about 75 miles. His descendants own the tavern. The
Westchester County Historical Bulletin of October, 1953 reports: There seems to be no record as to the
date of the establishment of this stage line or when it was discontinued. However, according to the
stories handed down through the family, the coming of the Harlem Railroad in the late eighteen forties
put it out of business. For years it was an important factor in transportation as notices bear witness.
[Jim - this Bulletin contains additional information on the Brick House and other information on the
stage coach line.] &#x27;Old Gid&#x27;, as he was called, kept relays of horses at White Plains and at the barn next
the Brick House. At one time his son, Young Gid, drove the stage and was known as a furious driver.
On Sundays, the family drove to church in the stagecoach, which delighted the village children. Born to
Betsey and Gideon were:</div>
