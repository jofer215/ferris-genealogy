            <div class="person-text">(2.1.4.1.1.9.1.1.2.2) MAURICE EUGENE SIMPSON (USN Rear Adm)
Rear Admiral Maurice E. Simpson, USN (Retired) passed away on February 16, 2004, near his home in Del Mar, Calif.
Born in Minnesota, in 1909, he completed his dental studies at the University of Minnesota in 1936, followed by a year&#x27;s
internship with the U.S. Public Health Service in the Marine Hospital at Norfolk, Virginia. In 1937, Simpson was appointed
lieutenant junior grade in the U.S. Navy, reporting to the Naval Medical Center in Washington, D.C., for indoctrination
before accepting his first duty assignment at the U.S. Naval Training Center in San Diego, Calif. One year later he was
transferred to the U.S. Marine Base, San Diego. Simpson was aboard the stores-issue ship USS Antares when the ship
entered Pearl Harbor at 8 a.m. on December 7, 1941. The ship was strafed and bombed by Japanese pilots. Simpson was a
dental officer on board the USS Washington starting in 1944 and saw combat action during seven major battles in the
Pacific Ocean including the Marianas Operation, the capture and occupation of the Philippine Islands, the South China
Sweep, the support and occupation of Iwo Jima and the operations at Ryukyu Islands. Following the hostilities with Japan,
Simpson served three years as chief of dental service in the U.S. Naval Hospital, Quantico, Virginia. In 1949, Simpson was
a dental officer at the port facilities in Tsingtao, China, with additional duty aboard the USS Repose. He was forced to leave
Tsingtao along with other military personnel when Nationalist Chinese troops abandoned the city to the Communists. One
month later, Simpson, who was then a commander, assumed duties aboard the USS El Dorado. For the next five months, the
ship steamed off the China coast and was one of the last two U.S. Naval vessels to leave the cities of Shanghai and Amoy
before the Communists took over. From July 1949 to June 1951, Simpson served at Fleet Activities and at the U.S. Naval
Hospital in Yokosuka, Japan. During that time, hostilities broke out in Korea, and because the Naval Hospital was closest, it

was overwhelmed with war wounded. Simpson was awarded the Navy Commendation Medal for his skill and leadership in
the treatment of the wounded in the U.S. Naval Hospital in Yokosuka. Simpson had a variety of assignments following his
duty in Japan, including Illinois, Washington, D.C., California and Virginia. He headed the dental department at the Naval
Station in Rota, Spain, from 1960 to 1963, and from 1963 to 1965 he served as dental officer of the San Francisco Naval
Shipyard. Simpson was promoted to rear admiral on July 1, 1964. Simpson returned to San Diego in July 1965 as director of
the dental activities and dental reserve program for the 11th Naval District until 1967. Simpson served as fleet dental officer
and assistant chief of staff of dentistry for the commander in chief of the Atlantic Fleet until his retirement in 1971. Simpson
was awarded nine separate medals with seven combat stars for the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign. In addition to the Legion of
Merit, Navy Commendation Medal and the Navy Unit Commendation, he was entitled to wear the American Defense
Service Medal with fleet clasp, the American Campaign Medal with Asia clasp, the China Service Medal, the Korean
Service Medal, the United Nations Service Medal and the Philippine Liberation Ribbon. Simpson served as a commissioned
U.S. Navy officer for over 33 years. After retirement, Simpson returned to San Diego, where he enjoyed golf with friends
and even made two holes-in-one. He also enjoyed travel with his wife, Ruby, who died in 1994. He leaves a sister, Betty and
her husband, Ray Vargas of Modesto, Calif.; and two sons, George, a retired Navy Captain in Washington, D.C., and Bill, a
retired Veteran Services Officer and his wife, Mary K. in Aptos, Calif. He also leaves three granddaughters, Debby Simpson
of Encinitas, Jennifer Simpson of Del Mar and Katie Simpson of Portland, Oregon. Memorial services will be held at 1:30
p.m. on Friday, February 20, at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot Chapel, 1600 Henderson Avenue, San Diego. Burial
services, with military honors, will be held at Arlington National Cemetery at 2 p.m. on Friday, March 5.</div>
