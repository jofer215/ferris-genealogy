            <div class="person-text">(2.5.3.4.1.6.6) MELANCTHON HOYT (#4663) (Rev.) (D.D.) born February 13, 1809 South Norwalk
CT and died January 2, 1888 Yankton SD
The First Master of the “Mother Lodge of the Dakotas”
Of all the early day Masons who came into Dakota, one of the most remarkable was the Rev.
Melancthon Hoyt. He was a broad-minded, Christian gentleman, whose hospitality was proverbial, and his time
and abilities were given to the promotion of all things beneficial to the Territory and to his fellowmen. Here was
an Episcopal Priest, spreading Masonry as well as Christianity on a number of frontiers. Melancthon Hoyt born
in South Norwalk, Connecticut, on February 13, 1809, the youngest son of Melancthon and Betsy (Taylor) Hoyt.
He prepared for college at Norwalk Academy, under the tuition of the Reverend Norman Pinney, and entered
Yale College, at the age of seventeen years, with the Class of 1826. He attended Yale College during the years of
1826 to 1830 and graduated with a degree in law in June 1830. He practiced law for one year, but could not
associate himself with some of the ethics of the legal profession of that time, so he decided that he could make a
greater contribution to humanity through the Church. He, therefore, entered the General Theological Seminary
at New York City in 1831 and was a student there through 1834, while studying for the Episcopal ministry. His
later correspondence with Bishop Kemper, the Episcopal Missionary Bishop of Wisconsin whose letters have
been preserved in the Kemper Papers in the State Historical Society of Wisconsin, indicates that he had to
withdraw from the Seminary for a while and teach school in order to earn enough money to pay his debts and
finish his theological training. He had not even graduated be-fore he began accepting positions as a supply
Minister in churches of Connecticut and New York.
On March 28, 1833, while still a student at the Seminary, he was married to Miss Ann Eliza Yarrington of
Flushing, Long Island, New York, in Trinity Church, New York City. To this union were born ten children, six
daughters and four sons. They were Mary, Elizabeth, Ann, Clara, Helen, Emma Jane, Robert, Samuel, William
and Melancthon U. Hoyt and with the exception of William all lived to maturity and had families.
Melancthon Hoyt was ordained an Episcopal Deacon on October 14, 1834, at Bridgeport, Connecticut, by
the Rt. Reverend Thomas Church Brownell, a Freemason and the Bishop of Connecticut. On August 23, 1835,
he was ordained as a Priest by the same Bishop at Camden, New Jersey. Following ordination as a Priest he
offered his services to the Domestic Missionary Society of the Episcopal Church of America, and was sent at
once to the Mission Field of Indiana, going first to Indianapolis. Bishop Kemper was consecrated first
Missionary Bishop of the Episcopal Church in September 1835, but Melancthon Hoyt preceded Bishop Kemper
to Indianapolis by six months. When Bishop Kemper-per arrived, he wrote that in all his large Diocese he had
found only one Clergyman and only one Church, the Clergyman being Melancthon Hoyt, and the Church being
in Missouri. From Indianapolis, Melancthon Hoyt moved to Crawfordsville, Indiana, where he organized St.
John’s Church and served the surrounding area as Missionary Minister from 1836 to 1838. He returned to
Connecticut and served as Rector of St. Andrew’s Church, Meriden, Connecticut, during 1838 and 1839. It was
at this time that he received his Doctor of Divinity Degree from Yale Theological School. He was offered the
chair of New Testament Greek at Yale University (the name had now been changed from Yale College) but

refused, declaring that having chosen to serve in the Missionary Field, and having put his shoulder to the wheel,
he dared not turn back. Thus the Reverend Melancthon Hoyt continued the Missionary career which lasted over
fifty-three years. He returned to the Mission Field by the end of 1839, having been sent to Grand Rapids,
Michigan, where he organized the first Episcopal Church. He stayed until 1843, when, early in that year, he
moved to Ionia, Michigan. From Ionia he was transferred across Lake Michigan to Green Bay, Wisconsin, where
he served the Parish of Christ Church Episcopal from 1845 to 1846. In the fall of 1846 he moved to Fox Lake,
Wisconsin, and later journeyed afoot in every direction, ministering to the souls of men as the Missionary of that
area. During this time he organized St. Paul’s Episcopal Church at Watertown, Wisconsin, and was called to be
the first Rector of that Church on June 7th, 1849. His salary at this time was $400 per year. He remained at
Watertown from 1849 through 1854. There is a difference of opinion as to where Melancthon Hoyt first received
light in Masonry. The family believes it was during his college days in the East or shortly thereafter. Grand
Lodge records in Michigan, Connecticut and New York show no Masonic activity on his part while living in
those states. The first known Masonic record that has been found for Melancthon Hoyt is in Wisconsin. Grand
Lodge records in that State show him belonging to Watertown Lodge U. D. at Watertown, Wisconsin, in the year
1852. In the same year this Lodge changed its name to Tucson No. 35, still located at Watertown. A careful
search of the Grand Lodge records could find no former affiliation. At the Grand Lodge communication in 1852
he acted as proxy for the Worshipful Master of the Watertown Lodge. At this communication he also acted as
Grand Chaplain pro-tem. Brother Hoyt served as Grand Chaplain for the Grand Lodge of Wisconsin in the years
1854, 1856 and 1856. He demitted from Tuscan Lodge No. 35 before leaving for Manitowoc, Wisconsin. It
should be recalled that it was the custom in those days for men coming west to carry demits, instead of writing
back for them. Also, in the early days men were often raised and took demits without taking membership in the
Lodge. Information is not available as to where and when Melancthon Hoyt was exalted to the degree of Royal
Arch Mason. The first capitular record we find for him was in 1853, when he was designated as Scribe of
Watertown or Howell Chapter No. 11 U. D., Watertown, Wisconsin. He served as the first High Priest of
Manitowoc Chapter No. 16, R. A. H., which was granted a Dispensation on February 4, 1857. During 1857 and
1858, he served the Grand Chapter of Wisconsin as Grand Chaplain. He returned to the shores of Lake
Michigan, this time to Manitowoc, Wisconsin, where on December 23, 1854, he had been called to become the
fourth Rector of St. James Episcopal Church, the oldest religious organization in the county. One of the first
private schools in Manitowoc was established in connection with the Episcopal Church. This was erected in
1856, through the efforts of the Reverend Melancthon Hoyt, and was taught by him.
Reverend Melancthon Hoyt was one of the leaders in the founding of Manitowoc Lodge No. 05, which was
granted a dispensation on February 19, 1856. He became the first Worshipful Master of this Lodge and the
records show that he served well. The last Masonic record of Melancthon Hoyt in Wisconsin shows that he
demitted from Manitowoc Lodge No. 65 on July 14, 1858.
On May 20, 1858, Melancthon Hoyt submitted his resignation to the St. James Church because of dire
necessity having used up his private funds. The resignation was accepted, but he was asked to supply the pulpit
until a new Rector could be found. On July 1, 1858, be left the Manitowoc Parish after having made a deep
impression on the public, religious and fraternal life of the community.
His next assignment was the frontier town of Sioux City, Iowa. It is said that when Mrs. Hoyt was told of the
new assignment she wept. Because of the hardships and privations she had endured over the many years, the
thought of another trip into the wilderness seemed almost too much. However, as she began to pack, she was
heard singing “To the West—to the West—to the land of the free Where the mighty Missouri rolls down to the
sea Where a man is a man, if he is willing to tail And the humblest may gather the fruits of the soil.” Melancthon
Hoyt left Manitowoc July 29, 1858, with his family in two covered wagons. It is interesting to note that the trail
followed by his family, with his two covered wagons, is the same now heavily traveled highways, numbers
Federal 151 and State 60 of Wisconsin and State 150 and Federal 20 of Iowa. They arrived in Sioux City, Iowa,

on September 5, 1858. There he organized the now fruitful parish of St. Thomas Episcopal Church. There he
conducted the principal school during 1858 and 1859 with an average of seventy pupils in attendance. In this
work he was assisted by his daughters, Elizabeth and Ann, who were well qualified to instruct the young.
On February 16, 1859, he affiliated with Sioux City Masonic Lodge No. 103, now Landmark No. 103. He
was elected and served as Master of this Lodge in 1860. On June 11, 1862, he demitted from the Lodge as he
was moving to Yankton in Dakota Territory. In the summer of 1860 Dr. Hoyt accompanied Bishop Joseph C.
Talbot on the first missionary exploration of the Episcopal Church in Dakota Territory, holding services in public
halls, and dwelling houses in Elk Point, Vermillion, Yankton and other places along the Missouri River. He
continued these visits in Dakota Territory, going to Yankton and as far as Niobrara, Nebraska. It was at this time
that the “Book of Common Prayer” was first used for public worship in Dakota. In 1861 he organized St. John’s
Parish in Yankton, with funds of $250, given to him by friends in the East. It was located at the corner of Fourth
and Linn streets. The building was ready for use by the early spring of 1862. In the summer of the same year he
moved his family from Sioux City to Yankton. Yankton now had its first Church building but was without a High
School. On August 10, 1867, the Dakotan reports, “Rev. M. Hoyt will leave about the first of September for the
east, for the purpose of securing funds by contribution for the erection of a High School or College in connection
with the Episcopal Church at Yankton.” Rev. Hoyt’s mission was successful and a school building was started.
On September 5, 1868, we find the following in the Dakotan, “We call attention of the people of Dakota to the
advertisement of Dakota Hall; a new educational institution to be opened in Yankton, on Monday, October 19th,
under the supervision of M. Hoyt, rector of Christ Church, Yankton.” This building was later moved to its
present site behind the Christ Church on Sixth street. It was veneered with brick to match the church and is still
(1960) a very useful educational building.
In 1865, St. John’s Parish organization was abandoned and a new organization under the name of
Christ Church Parish was legally incorporated, with M. U. Hoyt and Dr. Henry F. Livingston, son and son-in-law
of Dr. Hoyt, as Wardens. At this time a new and larger church was built at the northwest corner of Third and
Walnut streets. The first service was held in this new edifice by Dr. Melancthon Hoyt on November 25, 1865.
During the Indian uprisings in 1862 the Reverend Hoyt was appointed a Brigade Chaplain with the rank
of Captain- by William Jayne, Governor of the Territory, and was attached to the Staff of the Dakota Cavalry.
The first Masonic activity in Dakota Territory was his signing (along with several other Masons) of a
petition, to the Grand Lodge of Iowa, for a Dispensation for Dacotŕh (Dakota) Lodge No. 1 at Fort Randall,
Dakota Territory. The date of this petition was about March 1, 1862. Brother Hoyt’s connection with this Lodge
is not clear. The Dispensation was issued on April 23, 1862 ‘by the Grand Lodge of Iowa. At the Grand Lodge
communication in 1863 the Dispensation for Dacotah Lodge was renewed without charge. It appears that no
further steps were taken to complete the organization at Fort Randall. A charter was never issued.
Late in 1862 Brother Melancthon Hoyt and the requisite number of Brethren petitioned the Grand Lodge of
Iowa for a Dispensation to organize a Masonic Lodge in Yankton, Dakota Territory. On December 2nd, 1862, a
Dispensation was granted as follows:
“Therefore, be it known, That I, Edward A. Guilbert, acting Grand Master of Masons, in and for the State of
‘Iowa, by virtue of the power and authority in me vested, during the recess of the Grand Lodge, do hereby
appoint our trusty and well beloved Brother, Melancthon Hoyt, as Master, Brother D. T. Bramble, as Senior
Warden, John Hutchinson, as Junior Warden, F. M. Ziebach, H. C. Ash, G. N. Propper, Nelson Miner, 3. M.
Allen and Justus Townsend, to assemble and work as a regular Lodge, in the town and county aforesaid, in our
jurisdiction, by the designation of Saint John’s Lodge U. D. . .
The second session of the Territorial Legislature had been in session for 18 days when the Dispensation was
received on Thursday, December 18, 1862. Pursuant to an order by Worshipful Master Melancthon Hoyt the
Brethren assembled to organize the Lodge. By courtesy of the members of the Council, a body composed of
nine, four of whom were Freemasons, St. John’s Lodge U. D., was permitted to occupy the Chamber after

adjournment in the evening. It was here, December 18, 1862, on the second floor of the Capitol building that the
first recorded meeting of a Masonic Lodge was held in Dakota Territory.
On June 3, 1863 a Charter was issued to St. John’s Lodge No. 166 under the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge
of Iowa. The Reverend Melancthon Hoyt thus became the first Worshipful Master of the first Masonic Lodge
chartered in Dakota Territory. This gave St. John’s Lodge No. 166 the right to be called the “MOTHER LODGE
OF THE DAKOTAS.” When the Grand Lodge of Dakota was formed in 1875 at Elk Point, Dakota Territory, this
Lodge became known as St. John’s Lodge No. 1, because of its senior standing. Brother Hoyt served as
Worshipful Master of St. John’s Lodge in 1863, 1864, 1866 and 1870. Dakota’s oldest Masonic Bible was given
and dedicated in St. John’s Lodge by Brother Hoyt. Its sacred pages are worn thin by the touch of thousands of
Masonic hands resting thereon. Today this prized possession of St. John’s Lodge holds a place of honor, having
been placed permanently under glass in the Altar. Brother Hoyt served the Grand Lodge of Dakota as Chaplain
from 1875 through 1881.
In the summer of 1863 he was appointed United States Commissioner for the Second Judicial District by
Chief Justice Philemon Bliss, a Freemason and a member of St. John’s Lodge. This was the first appointment to
this office made in the Territory. When the fourth annual session of the Legislature of Dakota Territory convened
in Yankton on December 5, 1864, the Reverend Melancthon Hoyt was appointed Chaplain.
Reverend Melancthon Hoyt was a man with a restless spirit. He has been fittingly called the
“Champion Missionary-at-large of the Episcopal Church of America.” As a faithful Missionary, he was happiest
when he was pioneering. His record shows that he always left a settled community soon after he established a
church and moved on to a new region where his particular genius enabled him to establish new missions and
build them into parishes. He is credited with establishing fifty-one parishes during his lifetime, nearly half of
which were in Dakota. He lived at Swan Lake from 1878 to 1881; at Watertown in 1881; at Huron 1882-83; at
Hurley 1884-1887; and at Scotland 1887-1888. He built churches at Yankton, Elk Point, Vermillion, Eden (now
Hudson), Canton, Parker, Hurley, Watertown, Pierre, Springfield, Huron, Swan Lake, Aberdeen, Scotland,
Turner, Olivet, Lodi and others elsewhere. Driving his famous Indian ponies, Cap and Punch, he traveled
constantly, visiting homes, preaching, baptizing, caring for the sick, and bringing good cheer to all.
George W. Kingsbury of Yankton, a well-known early day publisher, historian and Freemason who was
Worshipful Master of St. John’s Lodge in 1868, 1869, 1871, 1877, 1878, and 1879 and a personal friend of
Melancthon Hoyt, had this to say: “Reverend Melancthon Hoyt was an ardent worker in the cause of education,
an earnest advocate and laborer for the establishment of schools, which new communities are sometimes
indifferent about. He was one of the most active and useful promoters of the first Historical Society (first
President), which flourished at Yankton in the early days and wherever enterprise and assistance were needed, in
his character as a citizen, he was found with his shoulder to the wheel. His ‘hospitality was proverbial, and his
time and abilities were given to the promotion of all things beneficial to the community and to his fellowmen.
While he was a rigid Episcopalian, he was a broad-minded, great-hearted Christian gentleman who reminded
one of the unostentatious divine mentioned in Goldsmith’s ‘Deserted Village,’ who took a personal interest in the
material, as well as the religious, welfare of all the people, and all the people held him in high esteem and bore
for him a warm affection. Men and women of all denominations were members of his congregation during the
early years, and many of these were among his strongest supporters and most valued friends.”
In 1875, Reverend Melancthon Hoyt gave up his work as rector of Christ Church, accepting the appointment
as general Missionary of the Jurisdiction. In 1884 he was given the enlarged title of Dean of the Diocese of
Dakota, which he held until his death in 1888.
The latest Masonic record found is dated April 13, 1885, by DeMolay Commandery No. 3 at Yankton, at
which time Companion Melancthon Hoyt upon dispensation, was created a Knight of the Most Illustrious Order
of the Red Cross. At the same time he was dubbed and created a Knight of the Most Valiant and Magnanimous
Order of the Temple, the Degree of St. Paul or Mediterranean Pass and the Order of Knights of Malta.

In 1885, the fiftieth anniversary of his entrance into the Missionary field was celebrated. Along with letters
of affection and congratulations, he received a purse of $250 in gold from his many friends. He retired for a time
but could not remain inactive. He wrote Bishop Hare: “Give me work, I am dying of ennui. Let me have a trial.
If I do not succeed I will come back to my prison”. Bishop Hare accordingly sent him to Scotland, Dakota
Territory, where, with his enthusiasm and energy the little flock of church people helped him start and almost
complete his last house of God. He conducted Christmas services in the new edifice, which was not properly
heated, and in so doing contracted a cold which turned into pneumonia. He never recovered and passed away on
January 2, 1888.
An obituary in the Daily Press and Dakotan on January 3, 1888, reads, “On Monday at 11:15 a. m. on the
second day of the new year his spirit took flight. The Reaper has gathered a full sheaf. [n the ripeness of years
and experience, one of Dakota’s earliest pioneers has been cut down. His life’s mission ended and he was ready
to be gathered to his Father. There is no one better known among the old Dakotans than Dr. Hoyt.”
On January 4, in the same paper, we find the glowing notice, “The members of St. John’s Lodge No. 1 A. F.
&amp; A. M. will meet at the Masonic Hall tomorrow, Thursday at 1 o’clock p. m. sharp for the funeral of our late
Brother Rev. M. Hoyt. All members of other lodges who may be in the city are fraternally requested to
participate.”
Services were held on January the 5th in the Congregational Church, as Christ Church Episcopal was
undergoing repairs following a fire. The service was read by Bishop Hare, assisted by the Rev. C. V. Himes of
Elk Point and the Rev. C. H. Bohn, rector of Christ Church, Yankton. Upon conclusion of the religious services,
the Masonic burial service was read by Worshipful Master William Blatt, of St. John’s Lodge No. 1. Past Grand
Master George H. Hand, member of St. John’s Lodge No. 1, made a few appropriate remarks on behalf of the
fraternity concerning the life of the deceased and expressing the love and esteem in which he had been held by
the Craft. The Lodge then formed in procession with members of the DeMolay Commandery as escorts and
proceeded to the Yankton Cemetery where the body was buried with Masonic Honors.
Mrs. Hoyt died on September 9, 1890 after having spent her last years with a son, Melancthon U. Hoyt, on a
farm in Cedar County, Nebraska, just across the Missouri River from Yankton. She was laid to rest beside her
husband in the Yankton Cemetery.
Regarded as the Father of the Episcopal Church in Dakota, he left a record of service to his Church and the
Masonic Fraternity that is equaled by few men. His picture hangs in the State Capitol Building at Pierre, South
Dakota, as one of the pioneer citizens of the State; in the Masonic Temple at Yankton as founder and first
Worshipful Master of St. John’s Lodge No. 1; as well as in the lobby of the Masonic Temple at Manitowoc,
Wisconsin, in memory of his great service to the Masonic Fraternity of that city.
It is hoped that this account of his life and labors might inspire new zeal and faith in the true principles of
our order. Surely this is the story of a working Mason who had - for his creed, “Duty is the one great law of
Masonry and is with us always, inflexible as fate.
