            <div class="person-text">(1.4.2) MARTHA FERRIS (3d born) married a Mr. Hennewell or Honeywell.
From Abstracts of Wills Vol VIII 1771-1776, page 189 – “In the name of God, Amen. I,
GILEAD HONEYWELL, of the Borrough town of Westchester, do signify by signing
and sealing hereof, and do make this my last will and Testament. All debts to be paid. I
leave to my wife Mercey, the use of all lands and houses, and meadows, and a oe25 right
in the Sheep Pasture, for her use and to bring up my children until my son Gilbert is of
age, and then she is to have the use of one half. I leave to my son Gilbert, when he is of
age, all my said lands, meadows, and rights; Also a negro boy. And he shall pay to my
daughter Elizabeth oe100 when eighteen, and to my daughter Mary oe100. I leave to
my daughter Elizabeth a negro girl and a good bed, and all the linnen mared with the
first two letters of her name. I leave to my daughter Mary a negro boy and a bed and the
linnen marked with her name. I leave to Mary Pell, wife of Joseph Pell, oe20. I leave to
my wife Mercey, all movables after debts and legacies are paid. If all my children
should die, then I leave all to my wife, and she shall pay to Thadeus and Alpheus Avery,
sons of Joseph Avery, oe200 each and oe100 to Mary Pell, wife of Joseph Pell. I make
my wife Mercey, and James Ferris, and Ebenezer Haviland, executors.
{Jim - this is placed here because of the name Honeywell. The name Mercey is
confusing...} To add to the confusion, the following is also provided. Abstract of Wills
Vol VIII 1771-1776, Page 147 - In the name of God, Amen. I, MARTHA RUMSHAW,

of New York, widow of John Rumshaw, August 13, 1774. I leave to my son William a
pair of gold sleeve buttons, marks M.S. I leave to my son John my large pair of open
shoe buckles. My executors are to sell all the rest of my estate at vendue, and the money
put at interest for my sons till they are of age. At the expiration of the lease by which I
hold my house and lot from the executors of Cornelius Van Horne, my executors shall
renew the lease. If both sons should die, I leave all to my sister, Mary Pell and to
Margaret Rumshaw, my husband’s daughter by a former wife. I make Peter Ricker and
Aaron Stockholm, executors. [Jim - I think we can correctly assume this Martha
Rumshaw is this Martha Ferris, particularly since she named her sister, Mary (Ferris)
Pell.] Thanks to Geri Wilson for this information.</div>
